While there have been detailed studies of the financial attractiveness of PV for home owners under different policy and retail market arrangements, there has been less consideration of the impacts of such systems on some other key industry participants. In this paper we undertake an investigation of the annual short-term revenue impacts of PV systems for those households installing them, for their electricity retailers and network service providers (NSPs), and for all electricity customers more in general, in the Australian State of NSW. We use actual half-hourly PV generation and electricity consumption for 80 households in Sydney to estimate the 'real world' impacts of a range of former, current and possible future PV policy and retail tariff arrangements including gross and net Feed-in-Tariffs (FiT). We found that the short-term revenue impacts differ significantly for different commercial arrangements and, are highly variable and largely driven by the PV performance and its match with household consumption patterns. Results highlight that current net metering policies in Australia with low net FiT rates may provide only moderate revenue incentives to households, yet quite adverse revenue impacts on NSPs and retailers depending on the level of PV export. While NSP short-term revenue losses will likely involve increasing electricity tariffs in the longer term, losses for retailers may add risks to the profitability of household customers with PV. The challenge for policy makers is to facilitate socially valuable PV deployment whilst appropriately managing the impacts on all key electricity industry stakeholders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a critical review of the literature in the field of demand response, providing an overview of the benefits and challenges of demand response. These benefits include the ability to balance fluctuations in renewable generation and consequently facilitate higher penetrations of renewable resources on the power system, an increase in economic efficiency through the implementation of real-time pricing, and a reduction in generation capacity requirements. Nevertheless, demand response is not without its challenges. The key challenges for demand response centre around establishing reliable control strategies and market frameworks so that the demand response resource can be used optimally. One of the greatest challenges for demand response is the lack of experience, and the consequent need to employ extensive assumptions when modelling and evaluating this resource. This paper concludes with an examination of these assumptions, which range from assuming a fixed linear price-demand relationship for price responsive demand, to modelling the highly diverse, distributed and uncertain demand response resource as a single, centralised negative generator, adopting fixed characteristics and constraints.

Moreover, there is a difference between desired load distribution and optimally-scheduled load across a 24-h time frame for lowering electricity bills. This difference in load usage timings, if it is beyond the tolerance level of a user, increases frustration. The comfort level is a highly variable phenomenon.

This paper examines the gasoline consumption demand of Greek households using cross-sectional micro-data from a country-wide Household Budget Survey (HBS) during the period 2004/05. The two-step Heckman modeling methodology is adopted to jointly estimate the probability of selecting to use private vehicle and the amount of using it. In this way, it can help to identify and better explain factors for which some private vehicle owners/holders do (not) actually consume that mode. The results offer valuable insight into the existence of feedback relationship between the decision-making mechanisms of selecting to use private vehicle and amount of usage, in terms of the amount of money spent for gasoline consumption. They also indicate the statistically significant impact of region-specific fixed effects, which implies that unobserved or omitted factors associated with each Region have a different impact on the decision to choose and the amount of using private vehicle. The income variable has a statistically significant positive impact on the selection and usage of a private vehicle. The estimated income elasticity suggests that a private vehicle travel is relatively inelastic (normal and necessity good). Its value reflects the increased car dependence and it is within the range of other income elasticities found in the literature. The male gender of household head, the amount of cars owned, the participation of family members in the labour market, the family size (a single-parent or couples with at least one child older than 18 years-old) and the expenditure on communication and tourism increase the probability of private vehicle gasoline consumption. The latter finding verifies that private vehicle constitutes an important means of transport during vacation. The use of communication devices, especially a mobile phone, reinforces the use of private vehicle, as it weakens the need for short-range activity planning in advance and the range and extent of social networking. On the contrary, the high population densities, the connection to the internet and the aging of household head reduce the probability of private vehicle gasoline consumption. The above results signify the role of personal and intra-household constraints, mostly related to size and aging structure, on the selection and use of a private vehicle. The expenditure on most other transport categories, such as an urban public transport, taxi, coach and rail negatively and statistically significantly affect private vehicle gasoline consumption. This outcome stresses the competitive relationship between the private vehicle and other transport modes which are mainly used in urban areas (urban bus, metro, and taxi). The study findings suggest the design of more sustainable leisure travel services, focussed on upgrading the quality of public transport modes servicing tourist resort areas. Policy measures to manage private vehicle use must be spatially targeted, accounting for the local climate, residential densities, infrastructure and accessibility conditions and the service quality of alternative modes in each Region. These measures can be supplemented with the adoption of suitable information and communication technologies to reduce the demand for private vehicle travel and increase the level of public transport services, as well as investments in clean vehicle technologies.",,,False,"Tsekeris, T",,38688,182128.0,2018-07-09 09:38:58.808502+00:00,0,False,,,Disaggregate Analysis of Gasoline Consumption Demand of Greek Households,False,,,True,

This study tested these hypotheses via an online, stated preference survey of 465 UK residents using actual market pricing and efficiency data for washing machines.

The air gases - oxygen, nitrogen and argon - are usually produced through cryogenic distillation, when a large amount of them are needed in high purity. In a cryogenic air separation unit (ASU), air is first liquefied at a very low temperature and then separated into different components through distillation. This is a very energy intensive process. For example, the Air Liquide Group runs about 400 ASUs worldwide, and its electricity consumption in 2010 was more than one thousandth of the total world electricity consumption. Steam methane reforming (SMR) is one important process to produce hydrogen and CO. In this process, natural gas is reacted with steam in a heated furnace at the presence of catalysts to produce syngas, which is a mixture of hydrogen, CO, methane, and other gases. This mixture is then further processed to produce pure hydrogen, CO, or certain mixtures. These products are often transported to customers through a pipeline, which connects multiple SMR plants and customers. SMR processes also consume a lot of energy, mainly in term of natural gas. Around half of Air Liquide's annual energy bill is for the purchase of natural gas. It can be seen that improving the efficiency of these industrial gas plants and pipelines is important in improving an industrial gas company's profit and competitiveness while reducing its energy consumption and carbon footprint. Real time optimization (RTO) is an important technique to achieve such a goal. A real time optimizer takes market dynamics such as changes in energy price and client demands into account in real time, and calculates the most profitable mode of operating the plants by using the plant models with energy consumption equations and process constraint equations. Then the calculated optimal set points are downloaded to the plant control system to ramp the plant or sent to operators as references. In this work, two RTO applications in industrial gas production are studied: one ASU plant and one SMR pipeline. The important aspects of the applications are addressed including the general IT structure and functions of its different software components, important steps in completing such projects, and major challenges and corresponding solutions in mathematical optimization.",,,False,"Li, T.",,103001,,2018-06-07 12:51:53.323581+00:00,0,True,,60.0,Real time optimization of industrial gas plants and networks,False,,,False,

In order for this 'energy turnaround' to take place, however, reducing residential energy consumption must go beyond using energy-efficient devices: More sustainable behaviour and lifestyles are essential parts of future 'energy aware' living. Addressing this issue from an HCI perspective, this paper presents the results of a 3-year research project dealing with the co-design and appropriation of a Home Energy Management System (HEMS) that has been rolled out in a living lab setting with seven households for a period of 18 months. Our HEMS is inspired by feedback systems in Sustainable Interaction Design and allows the monitoring of energy consumption in real-time. In contrast to existing research mainly focusing on how technology can persuade people to consume less energy ('what technology does to people'), our study focuses on the appropriation of energy feedback systems ('what people do with technology') and how newly developed practices can become a resource for future technology design. Therefore, we deliberately followed an open research design. In keeping with this approach, our study uncovers various responses, practices and obstacles of HEMS use. We show that HEMS use is characterized by a number of different features.

In particular, this study investigates to what extent residential heat pumps participating in load shifting can contribute to reducing operational costs and CO2 emissions associated with electric power generation and how home owners with heat pump systems can be best motivated to achieve these flexibility benefits. Residential heat pumps, when intelligently orchestrated in their operation, can lower operational costs and CO2 emissions by performing load shifting in order to reduce curtailment of electricity from renewable energy sources and improve the efficiency of dispatchable power plants. In order to study the interaction, both the electricity generation system and residences with heat pumps are modeled. In a first step, an integrated modeling approach is presented which represents the idealized case where the electrical grid operation in terms of unit commitment and dispatch is concurrently optimized with that of a large number of residential heat pumps located in homes designed to low-energy design standards. While this joint optimization approach does not lend itself for real-time implementation, it serves as an upper bound for the achievable operational cost savings. The main focus of this paper is to assess to what extent load shifting incentives are able to achieve the aforementioned savings potential. Two types of incentives are studied: direct load control and dynamic time-of-use pricing. Since both the electricity generation supply system and the residential building stock with heat pumps had been modeled for the joint optimization, the performance of both load shifting incentives can be compared by separately assessing the supply and demand side. Superior performance is noted for the direct-load control scenario, achieving 60-90% of the cost savings attained in the jointly optimized best-case scenario. In dynamic time-of-use pricing, poor performance in terms of reduced cost and emissions is noted when the heat pumps response is not taken into account. When the heat pumps response is taken into account, dynamic time-of-use pricing performs better. However, both dynamic time-of-use pricing schemes show inferior performance at high levels of residential heat pump penetration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Thermal storage plays an important role in building energy conservation, which is greatly assisted by the incorporation of latent heat storage (LHS) in building products. LHS in a phase change material (PCM) is very attractive because of its high storage density with small temperature swing. It has been demonstrated that for the development of a latent heat storage system (LHTS) in a building fabric, the choice of the PCM plays an important role in addition to heat transfer mechanism in the PCM. Thermal energy storage in the walls, ceiling and floor of buildings may be enhanced by encapsulating or embedding suitable PCMs within these surfaces. They can either capture solar energy directly or thermal energy through natural convection. Increasing the thermal storage capacity of a building can increase human comfort by decreasing the frequency of internal air temperature swings so that the indoor air temperature is closer to the desired temperature for a longer period of time.

The energy coordination problem has been formulated as a two-stage day-ahead resource scheduling problem, with the intermittent supply; the variable demand, which includes EVs; and the fluctuating real-time energy price modeled as random variables. The first stage produces day-ahead dispatch decisions for the dispatchable DG units.

A six-year farm-scale study was conducted to understand the impact of weather variability on biomass yield, determine optimal N fertilization and harvest timing management practices for sustainable biomass production, and estimate economic viability at six CRP sites in the United States. Precipitation during the growing season was a critical factor for annual biomass production across all regions, and annual biomass production was severely reduced when growing season precipitation was below 50% of average. The N rate of 112 kg ha(-1) produced the highest biomass yield at each location. Harvest timing resulting in the highest biomass yield was site-specific and was a factor of predominant grass type, seasonal precipitation, and the number of harvests taken per year. The use of N fertilizer for yield enhancement unambiguously increased the cost of biomass regardless of the harvest timing for all six sites.

The results point to the potential differences in the ways households interact with the in-home displays. The effects differed among various groups according to people's previous experiences with monitoring and their level of affluence. In the sample, affluent respondents living in detached houses tended to be accustomed to monitoring consumption before the display was introduced. These families used the display for controlling that nothing was wrong, but they did not use the information provided by the display to initiate new energy saving measures. In contrast, among less affluent flat owners the notion of control was specifically linked to the family's management of finances, and in this sense the displays empowered them. In addition, the results indicate that the in-home display for this group resulted in electricity savings.

In architecture, selection of sustainability assessment methods critically affects design goals, favoring or restricting choices designers can make. A building subsumes matter and energy to support human lives, but current building performance indicators are still hard to equate technical sides and human dominant sides of various scales in a synthetic metric. Moreover, in order to achieve global sustainability in a building, as a part of the whole built environment, it is necessary to integrate energy and environmental impacts at the highest scope of analysis. Emergy analysis coupled with building energy simulation can be suggested as a holistic indicator for architectural design process. To test the proposed method, a pilot study with a mid-size office building evaluates the consequences of early design decisions such as basic geometry, aspect ratio, window-wall ratio, construction types, etc. The integrated energy-emergy approach to building form optimization consists of three modules namely, Building Energy Simulation (BES) module, Building EMergy Analysis (BEMA) module, and (iii) MetaModel Development (MMD) module. The BES module uses the EnergyPlus tool for whole building energy analysis, while the BEMA module employs analytical methods to estimate emergy quantities, and the MMD module employs the Taguchi method to develop a metamodel for faster and easier whole building emergy simulation. The metamodel developed using Taguchi-ANOVA method for building form optimization was validated with analytical test results to accelerate environmental design decision-making. This study demonstrates possibility of wider applications of emergy synthesis to building energy research and facilitates practical use of emergy simulation in the environmental design process.

However, experts still project that energy prices will continue to rise due to shrinking resources. There are numerous renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, biomass, and hydrogen that show promise to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels (and the damage fossil fuels do to our environment), but these are longer term solutions. We have a technology that can make an immediate impact right now - Geothermal Heat Pump (GHP) systems. GHP systems have consistently demonstrated significant reductions in energy use and peak demand versus other HVAC systems. Other benefits of lower energy consumption are reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, reduced reliance on foreign energy sources, national security, and a reduction on the number of new power generating facilities required over time. This report will summarize available GHP technology, reasons GHP systems produce excellent efficiency as compared to other popular HVAC systems, options for the designer to consider to further reduce the operating cost of GHP systems, and miscellaneous building owner benefits not directly contributing to energy use reduction. Why are GHP systems not utilized more often? Unfortunately the HVAC design is often based on what the owner or designer is familiar with rather than sound economic analysis. There also seems to be a certain amount of misinformation and/or lack of understanding on GHP systems.

Deploying bi-directional smart meters and home energy management (HEM) agents that provision real-time usage monitoring and remote control, will enable HEM in smart households. Furthermore, the traditionally inelastic demand curve has began to change, and these emerging HEM technologies enable consumers (industrial to residential) to respond to the energy market behavior to reduce their consumption at peak prices, to supply reserves on a as-needed basis, and to reduce demand on the electric grid.

The ability to control the timing and magnitude of the aggregate electricity consumption of buildings is acquiring critical relevance. Buildings play a pivotal role in defining the shape and composition of the final electricity demand, and have an impact on the existing and projected electrical system infrastructure. This paper proposes distributed electrical storage using electrical batteries at the residential level, as an economical and technically feasible way to introduce a degree of responsiveness with the demand of residential buildings without compromising the comfort of users. The objective of the paper is to devise the operative principles governing the relation between the grid operator and a community of low exergy (lowEx) buildings, under the assumption that the grid operator is interested in controlling the form of the aggregate electricity consumption in that community. This paper presents a pricing policy aimed to stimulate a power-aware consumption, and consequently peak-shave the total electricity profile. The introduced pricing scheme separately addresses energy and power, and provides an incentive for buildings to invest in decentralized generation and storage technologies. The paper presents a methodology to determine the optimal amount of decentralized electrical storage and PV necessary to meet the objectives of the grid operator and allowing users to obtain a profit from the dynamic electricity tariff. A model is used to determine the optimal battery and PV investment from the perspective of the user. The analyses show that the introduced electricity tariff triggers an equilibrium, in which users invest between 20% and 25% of the total incurred cost in battery and PV. The PV and the battery input power were found to be mainly related to the objective of reducing the energy cost. On the other hand, the battery capacity and output power were found to be associated with the peak reduction objective. Users invest less than 10% of the total battery investment share in the battery input power. This fact indicates that contrary to a battery usage driven by the price volatility, which is proposed in many models, the battery is mainly used as power-to-energy buffer.

Through a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy, a consortium has been formed between the University of Nevada Las Vegas, Pulte Homes, and NV Energy (formerly known as Nevada Power) to address this issue. The team has been developing a series of approximately 200 homes in Las Vegas to study substation level peak electric load reduction strategies. The targeted goal of the project is a peak reduction of more than 65%, between 1:00 PM and 7:00 PM, compared to code standard housing developments. Energy performances of the homes have been monitored and the results were stored for further analysis. A computer model has been developed for one of the homes in the new development using building energy simulation code, ENERGY 10. Influence of different peak reduction strategies on the electricity demand from the home has been analyzed using the developed model. The simulations predict that the annual electrical energy demand from the energy efficient home compared to a code standard home of the same size decreases by 38%. The simulations have also shown that the energy efficient measures reduce the electricity demand from the home during the peak periods. Simulations on the photovoltaic (PV) orientation show that a south oriented PV system is best suited for a home enrolled to flat electricity pricing schedule and a 2200(400 west of due south) orientation is economically optimal for homes enrolled in the time-of-use pricing. The energy efficiency methods in the building coupled with a 2200 oriented PV and two degrees thermostat setback for three hours (from 3:00-6:00 PM) can reduce the peak demand by 62% compared to a code standard building of the same size.

First, active residential occupancy pattern of different individual household population classes are obtained from literature, then the individual electrical appliances are aggregated in such a way that reflects the income pattern of the households to form single individual household load profiles. The load profiles of the various individual households are aggregated to determine the overall residential load profile of the entire city.

Since occupants spend more than 87% of their time indoors, they are inseparable and significant elements of building system dynamics. Hence, there is a great potential for energy efficiency in buildings using a wide range of programs such as intervention and eco-feedback. Despite the high level of individual differences and intra-class variability of occupants' behaviors, the current state-of-the-art eco-feedback programs treat all the occupants uniformly and do not target and tailor the feedback. Therefore, it leaves an opportunity to increase the efficacy of eco-feedback systems through the designing of tailored and targeted programs. In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive analysis and tested hypotheses on occupants' behavioral responses to a normative comparison feedback program, in addition to the impact of notifications on the level of engagement of each group of occupants. We categorized occupants who participated in the normative comparison feedback program into three groups (i.e. low, medium, and high energy consumers) based on their baseline energy consumption, and tested 9 hypotheses. A mixed-effect regression model (MRM) and a paired t-test was implemented to evaluate the proposed hypotheses. The hypotheses examine the variability of occupants' responses under the same eco-feedback program, and the effectiveness of notifications on reinforcing occupants' engagement in these programs. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1) reporting that the effectiveness of the notifications in eco-feedback programs are initially highly dependent on the type and the nature of the program, and then the interval and the content of the notification, and (2) demonstrating the variability of occupants' behavioral responses under the same normative comparison eco-feedback program. These findings indicate the need for a shift in focus toward targeted and tailored feedback programs which treat occupants based on their characteristics. Moreover, they highlight the need for eco-feedback design, development, testing and implementation research that acknowledges and addresses differences in occupant responses to feedback.

These upgrades requires heavy investments, consequently, driving up electricity prices. Solar air-conditioning systems can reduce this trend, but current vapor-compression air-conditioners (VCACs) needs very large investments in both photovoltaic system and battery storage. Alternatively solar heat-driven absorption chillers need less expensive solar collectors and thermal storage, drawing only small amounts of electricity to overcome parasitic power. There are ample studies conducted previously on either the technical and/or economic feasibility of solar heat driven absorption chillers. But these studies are only focused on supplementing solar heat energy with an auxiliary heater. This study, examines the option of running the absorption chiller by solely relying on solar heat energy. It focuses on minimizing the life cycle cost of a solar heat driven absorption chiller through optimizing the size of all of its main components. The system is named the standalone solar heat fired absorption chiller (SA-SHF-ABS-CH) sized to sufficiently meet the space conditioning demands, both heating and cooling, of a typical Australian 6 star home. For the aims of this research, TRNSYS17 software was used in modelling and dynamically simulating the integrated system, while GenOpt software was used to carry out the optimization. The economic assessment on the most optimally sized system component configuration shows, firstly, the twenty-year lifecycle cost of the system with the most minimized cost is AU$ 53,387 in Brisbane, AU$ 51,639 in Adelaide and AU$ 32,816 in Melbourne. These investment costs in each of these cities appear higher than those incurred if the householder were to instead install a standard efficient inverter, ducted, reverse cycle air conditioner (IRC-AA-HP) powered by grid electricity; as follows: Brisbane at 77%, Adelaide at 58% and Melbourne at 28%. Secondly, the payback period was found to be longer than the twenty-year system service- life, which is far too long to justify the investment on such solar air-conditioner. However, when compared with IRC-AA-HP, in Adelaide and Melbourne, SA-SHF-ABS-CH consumed at least 50% less power, meaning it offsets half of the carbon dioxide emissions, furthermore, it draws 75% lesser critical peak kWp power, which means it has strong potential to obviate the need for heavy investments in electrical infrastructures, ultimately contributing to mitigating rapid electricity price rises. © 2016 The Authors.",,,False,"Abdullah, G.F.",,277641,,2018-06-07 14:53:06.711893+00:00,0,True,,91.0,Optimization of Standalone Solar Heat Fired Absorption Chiller for Typical Australian Homes,False,,,False,

Three salt hydrates (MgCl2, Na2S, and SrBr2), one adsorbent (zeolite 13X) and one ideal composite based on CaCl2, are used as active materials in solid sorption systems. One liquid sorption system based on NaOH is also considered in this analysis. The focus is on open solid sorption systems, which are compared with closed sorption systems and with the liquid sorption system. The main results show that, for the assumed reactor layouts, the closed solid sorption systems are generally more expensive compared to open systems. The use of the ideal composite represented a good compromise between energy density and storage capacity costs, assuming a sufficient hydrothermal stability. The ideal liquid system resulted more affordable in terms of reactor and active material costs but less compact compared to the systems based on the pure adsorbent and certain salt hydrates.

Smart homes define optimal consumption as either balancing/leveling consumption using energy storage devices such that the utility company is presented with a uniform demand or as minimizing consumption costs by storing energy during off-peak time periods when prices are lower and use the stored energy during peak time periods when prices are higher. In cost minimization scheme, household is the sole beneficiary and its consumption profile is highly nonuniform and there is no incentive for the utility company to support this scheme. On the other hand, in consumption leveling/balancing scheme there is an incentive for both the household and utility company to support this scheme due to reduction in consumption costs for the former and uniform demand for the latter. Due to varying nature of energy requirements of households and market energy prices over different time periods in a day, households face a tradeoff between consuming to meet their current energy requirements and/or storing energy for future consumption and/or spending energy stored in the past. These tradeoffs aremodeled using inter-temporal trade and consumption preferences of households are modeled as utility functions using consumer theory. We introduce two different utility functions, one for cost minimization and another for consumption balancing/leveling, that are maximized subject to certain budget, consumption, storage and savings constraints to solve for the optimum consumption profile. The optimization problem of a household with energy storage is formulated as a geometric program for consumption balancing/leveling, while cost minimization is formulated as a linear programming problem.

The owner who leases the building using a triple net lease does the upgrade prior to leasing the building, with the expectation of earning higher rents. How much should the owner who leases the property spend for a given rent per square foot increase? Design/methodology/approach – The empirical study highlights the impact of key financial variables on the dependent variable medical office construction spending put in place in the USA. The independent variables prime interest rate, cost of natural gas per therm and electricity cost per KWH, resale building prices are significant variables when predicting medical office construction spending. A case study using a cost-benefit model is developed. It inputs corporate income tax rates, incorporates a debt service coverage ratio, prime interest rate, analyzes investment tax credit (ITC) and rebate scenarios and varies the level of rental income and energy savings. The case study results provide insight into which factors are enabling higher net construction spending when considering a green energy retrofit project. Both the regression model and the case study model focussed on the owner of a building who rents medical office space to tenants using a triple net lease. The owner/lessor paradigm analyzes revenue enhancements, the tax implications of having these savings and benefits associated with borrowing when financing the green retrofit. The availability of low cost borrowing, increases in the ITC percent and rebates and increases in rent per square foot have an impact on potential energy upgrade spending. Findings – The empirical model finds the independent variables to be significant. Utility cost, resale value of office buildings, the prime interest rate, business bankruptcy court filings and unemployment rate fluctuations adequately explain movements in medical office building spending for the years 2000 through 2015 yielding a R2 of 73.8 percent. The feasibility case study indicates that the energy saving levels and ITCs not income tax rates are the primary drivers for a partial energy retrofit. Research limitations/implications – Market incentives are a function of the cost of energy. If the cost of energy drops, then the profit incentive to conserve energy becomes less important. The role of tax credits, rebates, property tax reductions and government directives, then become primary incentives for installing energy upgrades. The owner of an empty building assumes all of the operating costs normally paid by a tenant under a triple net lease. This possibility was not included in the replacement cost-benefit model used in this paper. Practical implications – The feasibility of doing an energy upgrade to an existing building requires that a cost-benefit analysis be undertaken. The independent variables that are significant when doing a regression model or proxies for these variables are incorporated into a present value model. The results in Table V can be used as an initial template for determining how much to spend per square foot when doing an energy upgrade. The square foot amounts can be applied to different size office buildings. The corporate income tax rate or a personal income tax rate has minimal impact on energy construction upgrade spending. Social implications – More energy efficient office buildings reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. Energy efficient buildings also conserve on scarce fuel reserves. ITCs and rebates limit the role of government in directing decisions to do energy upgrades. The market mechanism to some degree can help encourage energy conservation through asset upgrades. Originality/value – The paper incorporates an empirical model which is a form of technical analysis to examine independent variables that explain medical office building spending with a case study structured on expected revenues and costs which takes a fundamental approach to understanding the relationship between the dependent variable and its independent variables. The regression model combines factors that impact the demand for energy efficient medical buildings from an owner/lessor perspective which includes resale values of existing buildings, business bankruptcy filings and unemployment rates. Supply independent variables include the prime interest rate and electricity per KWH and natural gas per therm. The regression model found these variables to be significant.

Therefore, such investment is presently only feasible when incentives such as capital grants exist. The total carbon dioxide emissions and load profile both see improvements when micro-CHPs are present. Furthermore, with the RTP scenario, on/off switching of many micro-CHP units causes the aggregate load profile to behave stochastically as the prices change and this is especially true during summer months. Therefore, the methodology for pricing units of energy needs to be thought through thoroughly before implementing RTP in the residential sector. ©2010 IEEE.",,,False,"Sudtharalingam, S.",,457248,,2018-06-07 15:41:32.195105+00:00,0,True,,82.0,Feasibility of domestic micro combined heat and power units with real time pricing,False,,,False,

It is found that the presence of shallow convection in the subtropics helps set the width and intensity of oceanic ITCZs, a mechanism here termed the shallow cumulus humidity throttle because of the control exerted on the moisture supply to the deep convection zones. These conclusions are reached after investigations based on a tropical climate model of intermediate complexity, with sufficient vertical degrees of freedom to capture (i) the effects of shallow convection on the boundary layer moisture budget and (ii) the dependency of deep convection on the free-tropospheric humidity. An explicit shallow cumulus mixing time scale in this simple parameterization is varied to assess sensitivity, with moist static energy budget analysis aiding to identify how the local effect of shallow convection is balanced globally. A reduction in the mixing efficiency of shallow convection leads to a more humid atmospheric mixed layer, and less surface evaporation, with a drier free troposphere outside of the convecting zones. Advection of drier free-tropospheric air from the subtropics by transients such as dry intrusions, as well as by mean inflow, causes a substantial narrowing of the convection zones by inhibition of deep convection at their margins. In the tropical mean, the reduction of convection by this narrowing more than compensates for the reduction in surface evaporation. Balance is established via a substantial decrease in tropospheric temperatures throughout the Tropics, associated with the reduction in convective heating. The temperature response-and associated radiative contribution to the net flux into the column-have broad spatial scales, while the reduction of surface evaporation is concentrated outside of the convecting zones. This results in differential net flux across the convecting zone, in a sense that acts to destabilize those areas that do convect. This results in stronger large-scale convergence and more intense convection within a narrower area. Finally, mixed layer ocean experiments show that in a coupled ocean-atmosphere system this indirect feedback mechanism can lead to SST differences up to +2 K between cases with different shallow cumulus mixing time, tending to counteract the direct radiative impact of low subtropical clouds on SST.",,,False,"Neggers, RAJ",,462959,184809.0,2018-06-11 15:26:38.832847+00:00,0,True,,76.0,Impact mechanisms of shallow cumulus convection on tropical climate dynamics,False,,,True,

This information exchange is done through the wireless communication network within the smart grid. Wireless transmissions are error-prone and transmission errors will result in a loss of precision in demand control, which will further lead to a loss of profit to the operator.

Design/methodology/approach - Digital technologies were used to automatically measure and communicate the electricity consumption of 316 UK residents for a period of 16 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: one involving no feedback; one involving feedback about a household's own usage, and one involving a household's own usage plus social norms feedback (the average consumption of others in the locality). At the end of the study, a selection of participants took part in interviews or focus groups. Findings - Both types of feedback (individual and individual-plus-social-norms) led to reductions in consumption of about 3 per cent. Those receiving social norms feedback were significantly more likely to engage with the information provided. However, the social norms information had no additional impact on consumption. Survey and interview data confirmed that participants from both conditions had been encouraged to adopt new energy-saving practices. The study concludes that near real-time individual feedback can be sufficient for usage reduction if it is provided in a historical format. It also suggests that the impact of social norms information may previously have been confounded with that of individual feedback.

In order to increase the awareness of the investors on the long-term advantages of these solutions, pilot projects are necessary that provide real-time monitoring on the energy performance and behaviour of energy efficient buildings. At the Politehnica University of Timisoara, an experimental programme was developed to demonstrate that applying passive house design principles could be an alternative solution for energy-efficient buildings, reflecting the Romanian local climate conditions, materials, and construction techniques. An energy-efficient house was built following the passive house design principles and was subjected to extensive monitoring. In the design phase, the discussed house is compared to a reference house designed following the energy efficiency requirements in Romania, in order to emphasise the differences in terms of energy demand and life-cycle cost. The life-cycle cost analysis results are dependent on the future growth of energy prices.

Recent advances in energy monitoring and control technologies have enabled the development of eco-feedback systems that collect, process, and relay high resolution, real-time energy consumption information to help building occupants control their energy-use.

Informative metrics are required to quantify the revenue variance of a spatially distributed portfolio of PV assets as well as the individual asset. Financial analysis uses a risk measure known as 'beta' to describe the movement of assets relative to a broader portfolio. We define a measure termed the 'solar beta' that describes the movement of solar PV revenues at a given site with that of a portfolio of sites. The solar beta incorporates correlation between a site and portfolio, and the volatility of a site relative to the portfolio. We also derive and discuss a method to decompose revenue variance of individual PV assets into components representing price, power, and the interplay among diurnal/seasonal cycles and prevailing weather conditions. This decomposition and the solar beta are illustrated using nine modeled sites following a N-S trend within the PJM Interconnection. We find that revenue variance of a PV asset depends more on diurnal, seasonal, and meteorological fluctuations than on price fluctuations at a particular site. Specifically, the contribution of power variance exceeds the contribution of price variance by roughly a factor of five. Changes in mean market price have a larger effect on revenue variance compared to a proportional change in mean power production. The solar beta was found to be near 1.0 for most sites, indicating strong covariance within the portfolio due in large part to high correlation rather than similar volatility ratios. Lower beta values were found for sites at the perimeters of the study region, due to change in climate regime and population-power consumption cycles, implying portfolio risk reduction when these sites are included.

When households possess an immediate feedback on their consumption, it is usually stated that they can save between 5 and 15% of their electricity.

In order to know whether 15% saving is a limit or not, it is necessary to understand what people do and learn with the use of an electricity monitor.

This paper explores the dimension of material culture in household energy consumption through the introduction of electricity monitors in different types of households. Through a social experiment, we investigate both how households appropriate an electricity monitor and what they learn when using it.

In order to improve energy efficiency the use of innovative market mechanisms, such as the White Certificates (WhC), has been proposed. The basic idea underlying this policy instrument is that specific energy saving targets are set for energy suppliers or energy distributors. These requirements must be fulfilled in a predefined time frame. The focus of this paper is on the effect on energy efficiency improvement, on the behavior of the end consumers and the market of energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, we study the possible effects of WhC in The Netherlands by means of a theoretical analysis and an empirical bottom-up model. We compare concrete energy efficient technologies in terms of cost-effectiveness and energy efficiency improvement. In combination with existing Dutch policies for energy efficiency improvement in the built environment, the contribution of this innovative scheme could enhance the accomplishment of energy efficiency targets. In this paper, two packages of energy saving measures of a WhC scheme are studied for Dutch households. The costs of these technologies are estimated through the use of different discount rates, which imply overcoming of the market barriers through the use of the WhC. A scheme that includes all available technologies as flexible options appears as a realistic solution and can generate cost effectively up to 180 PJ primary energy savings and 4550 ME cumulative net savings in the year 2020, at a discount rate of 5%, under the precondition that the policy and administrative costs can be kept low.

Design/methodology/approach - Residents of 39 suites in a freshman residence hall competed against one another to reduce energy consumption and win prizes as part of a three-week competition. Feedback was provided in near real-time at the suite-level via an interactive touch-screen kiosk. Participants also completed baseline and follow-up surveys. Findings - Electricity use among all suites was approximately 6.4 per cent lower during the competition period compared to baseline, a significant reduction. Additionally, participants reported engaging in various pro-environmental behaviors significantly more frequently during the competition relative to baseline. Changes in pro-environmental behavior were associated with changes in level of group identification and perceived social norms. Practical implications - In three weeks, dormitory residents saved 3,158 kWh of electricity compared to baseline - the equivalent of more than 3,470 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions.

Momentum is growing for transitioning residential consumers toward more 'cost-reflective' pricing that better reflects the true costs of generation and supply, and sends a 'price signal' that presumably incentivises reduced consumption during peak periods. Under such tariffs, customers pay more for electricity used during times of peak demand - unlike traditional 'flat rate' tariffs where the price remains stable regardless of time or demand. Pilot trials indicate that cost reflective tariffs might succeed in reducing peak demand, but often only for a small minority of customers, such that population-wide demand response is minimal or insignificant. In this paper, we apply insights from psychology and behavioural economics to identify how cost-reflective pricing can be designed, depicted and delivered to enhance customer uptake and optimal usage-thereby facilitating 'appropriate' demand response - for a larger cross-section of the population. By carefully considering the likely impact of relevant cognitive biases and psychological factors-which routinely shape human decision making and behaviour - we are able to propose practical strategies that industry can adopt to maximise the prospect of cost-reflective pricing achieving significant population-level peak demand reductions, while providing shared benefits for customers, retailers, networks and regulators alike.

According to climatologists, changing human energy-consumption behaviours now appears to be the best, and probably the only possible option, given the urgency of the situation. However, changing human energy-consumption behaviours is not easy. Psychological studies have identified general psychological barriers that limit or hinder these behaviour changes (limited cognition, ideologies, comparison with other people, perceived risk . . .), and it has proposed different kinds of interventions (e.g., information, feedback, social motives, financial incentives . . .). However, it is clear that psychologists must work with other scientists in order to find better solutions for changing behaviours.

Principles such as linking invention and disposal, promoting renewal and reuse, quality and equality, de-coupling ownership and identity, and using natural models and reflection have been proposed to reduce the consumption, of both energy and resources while developing software and hardware. In addition to those technology-centred principles, two other principles have been proposed: making people aware of their energy consumption and persuading people to change their consumption behaviours.

Most 'green' policy instruments that have emerged in recent decades have targeted facilitation of the development and adoption of greener processes, goods and services. Concurrent business models have sought to create and capture value arising from this policy-induced transition to more environmentally sustainable practices. Both such policy instruments and the business models are, however, often evaluated more in terms of their impact on the development and adoption of innovations and less in terms of their impact on behavioural change. This paper provides a critical review of the interplay between green policy instruments and green business models from a behavioural perspective. Instead of looking at policy instruments from a technology-push and demand-pull perspective, this paper samples them in terms of 'sticks', 'carrots' and 'sermons' and then provides a critical review of business models that have emerged in response to these types of policy regimes. The paper finds that most green business models that have emerged in the built environment - in response to sticks - may be characterised as buck-passing, i.e. passing costs to others and skirting around the stick of regulation. Those that emerge in response to carrots as opportunistic carpet-bagging aimed at capturing a temporary gain. Finally, those that emerged in response to sermon-orientated awareness campaigns, show a tendency to diffuse even in the absence of supportive fiscal conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, providing information to building managers and tenants is the first step in identifying ways to reduce power consumption. Since reducing anomalous consumption can have a large impact, this study proposes a novel approach to using large sets of data for a building space to identify anomalous power consumption. This method identifies anomalies in two stages: consumption prediction and anomaly detection. Daily real-time consumption is predicted by using a hybrid neural net ARIMA (auto-regressive integrated moving average) model of daily consumption. Anomalies are then identified by differences between real and predicted consumption by applying the two-sigma rule. The experimental results for a 17-week study of electricity consumption in a building office space confirm that the method can detect anomalous values in real time. Another contribution of the study is the development of a formalized methodology for detecting anomalous patterns in large data sets for real-time of building office space energy consumption. Moreover, the prediction component can be used to plan electricity usage while the anomaly detection component can be used to understand the energy consumption behaviors of tenants.

Experiment 1 exemplifies the successful use of combining goal setting and feedback, and provides a basic understanding of the interaction from the perspectives of goal setting theory and feedback intervention theory (FIT). Experiment 2 compares FIT to another, fundamentally different, cognitive framework, and the minimal justification principle. The study gives insight into how goals and feedback work through attention focus and the goal hierarchy to guide behavior, the role of attitude in this process, and offers evidence that FIT better accounts for task specific conservation behavior.

Results of this study suggest the need for more development of the basic theory and illustrate the strong motivational properties of having a goal.

Although these challenges add to the locational and time dependency of the underlying cost of operating the system, this variability in time and location is not reflected in residential tariff schemes. Consequently, residential users are not incentivised to react to varying system conditions and to help the integration of renewable energy resources. Therefore, this paper provides a theoretical framework for designing a locational dynamic pricing scheme. This can be used to assess existing tariff structures for consumption and injection, and can serve as a theoretical background for developing new tariff schemes. Starting from the underlying costs, this paper shows that the potential for locational dynamic pricing depends on the locational and time dependency of its cost drivers. When converting costs into tariffs, the tariff design should be determined. This includes the advance notice of sending tariffs to users, and the length of price blocks and price patterns. This tariff design should find a balance between tariff principles related to costs, practicality and social acceptability on the one hand, and the resulting demand response incentive on the other.

Based on the literature, six scenarios were developed in order to find the break-even point, where e(invested) = e(saved). The results show that the overall impact is dependent on the type of HEMS, and that if the duration of use is short and the achieved savings are small, the benefits do not always outweigh the environmental costs. Care should be taken not to develop HEMS with unnecessarily elaborate parts or functionalities and that their own electricity consumption is minimized. The paper concludes by discussing the implication for polices concerning the implementation of smart meters and HEMS and their design. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, seasonal price and income elasticities of electricity demand in the residential sector of all urban areas of India are estimated for the first time using disaggregate level survey data for about 30,000 households. Three electricity demand functions have been econometrically estimated using monthly data for the winter, monsoon and summer season in order to understand the extent to which factors like income, prices, household size and other household specific characteristics, influence variations observed in individual households' electricity demand. The results show electricity demand is income and price inelastic in all three seasons, and that household, demographic and geographical variables are significant in determining electricity demand.

Given that network costs are significantly driven by peak capacity requirements, many proposals for more cost-reflective tariffs include a demand (capacity) component. However, there are many complexities in the implementation of such tariffs. This paper first presents a method to visually assess how cost-reflective a particular demand charge network tariffs is. We apply it to a typical demand charge network tariff proposal within the Australian National Electricity Market and actual consumption data of 3876 Sydney households, and find it to have low cost-reflectivity in terms of aligning customer bills with their contribution towards network peak demand. Such misalignment has potentially significant adverse impacts on the economic efficiency of such tariffs an issue that does not appear to have received sufficient policy attention. We then use this assessment method to demonstrate how a demand charge tariff structure can be adjusted to make it significantly more cost-reflective.

The experiment included a control group (G1: the self-monitoring group) and one equipped group (G2). All participants reduced their consumption and learnt either directly from feedback or indirectly through self-monitoring. The amount of energy savings, which is larger than in similar experiments, can be explained by two factors. First, the specificity of our sample (i.e. high income, high consumption) which allows for potentially large energy savings. Second, high involvement of participants and the building of trust. The quantitative and qualitative dimensions of learning are then discussed. Additionally, we focus on peak-load shifting in G2 with 2 subgroups (G21 and G22). The higher proportion of shifters in G22 and the higher 'quality' of their shifting suggest a higher level of learning enabled by the more sophisticated feedback.

Especially in tropical countries where the thermal flow is strong and the lack of electricity distribution networks is a sad reality. The consolidation of this energy efficiency requires the preservation of nature through a harmony between the building and its environment on one hand and an effective evaluation of energy performance on the other hand. Faced with these challenges, the bioclimatic concept is one of the best alternatives to weave this harmony between the building and its environment. Furthermore a meaningful energy performance assessment of buildings based on the knowledge of capitalization with the experience feedback processes can be used to structure the different phases of implementation of the buildings. Firstly, this article presents the general concept of bioclimatic buildings with emphasis on thermal notions that influence thermal comfort inside a building. Secondly, the effort focuses on identifying non-qualities and factors of discomfort whose resolution helps to improve the energy and environmental performance of buildings. This approach supported by land surveys to interview the building actors and users to collect data favourable or not favourable to energy-performance.

Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences (IAP RAS CM), mutual lags between global mean surface air temperature, T and the atmospheric CO2 content, q, in dependence of the type and time scale of the external forcing are explored. In the simulation, which follows the protocol of the Coupled Models Intercomparison Project, phase 5, T leads q for volcanically-induced climate variations. In contrast, T lags behind q for changes caused by anthropogenic CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. In additional idealized numerical experiments, driven by periodic external emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, T always lags behind q as expected. In contrast, if the model is driven by the periodic non-greenhouse radiative forcing, T leads q for the external forcing time scale <= 4 x10(2) yr, while q leads Tat longer scales. The latter is an example that lagged correlations do not necessarily represent causal relationships in a system. This apparently counter-intuitive result, however, is a direct consequence of i) temperature sensitivity of the soil carbon stock (which decreases if climate is warmed and increases if climate is cooled), ii) conservation of total mass of carbon in the system in the absence of external carbon emissions, iii) increased importance of the oceanic branch of the carbon cycle at longer time scales. The results obtained with an EMIC are further interpreted with a conceptual Earth system model consisting of an energy balance climate model and a globally averaged carbon cycle model. The obtained results have implications to the empirical studies attempting to understand the origins of the contemporary climate change by applying lead lag relationships to empirical data.

Currently Sweden and Norway aim to expand the renewable electricity production by 26.4 TWh between 2012 and 2020, and subsequently to reduce CO2 emissions. To achieve this, the Swedish Energy Agency issues to renewable producers electricity certificates, which are sold on an open market to increase revenues. Meanwhile, the electricity is priced based on a marginal cost principle, and the price is highly reliant on the capacity profile and energy balance in the system, and consequently on the expanding and decommissioning decisions. The above price issues, together with the intermittent availability of renewable energy sources and the uncertainty of future fuel costs, will significantly affect the economic performance of the electricity producers. It is only after understanding the interaction of those factors that we can define companies' business models for achieving a sustainable development in the electricity sector. This study applies a system dynamics approach and presents a model to integrate both strategic decisions such as capacity expansion/decommission, and operational features such as randomness and seasonal factors in electricity production. The model highlights the complex and nonlinear interaction of important factors in the electricity sector. The study results indicate that the energy policy should not be introduced in an isolated manner, but rather need to incorporate the incentives of renewables with other decisions such as nuclear decommission. Additionally, this study predicts an upcoming increase in electricity price, as well as a more volatile price after the capacity profile has been changed and dominated by hydro, biomass and wind.

Methods: In order to achieve the aim of this paper, co-integration techniques have been applied. Through these techniques, we have analyzed the long-term relationship between consumption of renewable and non-renewable and economic development and pollution during the period 1980-2010. After a selection process, for Spain we have used to measure growth the GDP and the Gross Capital Formation; to measure development, the Index of Human Development and Social Capital; for pollution, the emissions of CO2 and consumption of renewable energy in the electricity system and oil consumption for the consumption of renewable and non-renewable, respectively. Secondly, we have compared the results obtained for the Spanish economy with the four biggest economies in the European Union: Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. Given the availability of data for these countries Gross Capital Formation and Human Development Index have been excluded from the analysis. Results: First, a positive impact of consumption of renewable and renewable energy on growth and development is found for the five countries under study, with a greater impact of non-renewable energy. For the three countries for which the data for CO2 emissions are available (Spain, France and the UK), it is observed that the reducing effect of renewable energy on CO2 emissions is less than the polluting effect of non-renewable energy. Second, for Spain, Germany and France, the data point out a feedback process between the consumption of non-renewable and growth and development, which is not observed with the consumption of renewable energy. Conclusions: In order to reconcile the objective of growth with the reduction of pollution, more moderate growth rates are required.

We analyze changes in electricity consumption based on a test group and a reference group of 12 households, respectively. To allow for analysis on load shift impact on CO(2)eq emissions, hourly dynamic CO(2)eq intensity of the Swedish electricity grid mix is calculated, using electricity generation data, trading data, and fuel-type specific emission factors. The results suggest that, on average, the test households shifted roughly 5% of their total daily electricity consumption from peak hours (of high electricity price) to off-peak hours (of low electricity price) as an effect of real-time price visualization. However, due to the mechanisms of the Swedish electricity market, with a negative relation between spot price and CO2 eq intensity, the load shift led to a split effect; electricity costs modestly decreased while CO(2)eq emissions increased. In addition, any indication of the contribution of real-time spot price visualization to a reduction in overall household electricity consumption level could not be found, as the relative difference in consumption level between the test households and the reference households remained constant during both the baseline period and the test period.

In this study, we conduct a field experiment in an apartment complex in India to test how information about electricity usage impacts the electricity consumption of urban middle class households. Our results, based on fifteen-minute electricity readings over an academic year, show that non-monetary messages that framed electricity consumption in terms of environmental and health impacts were more effective than messages emphasizing the monetary savings of reducing electricity consumption. Households in the environmental/health group accessed the online energy-monitoring dashboard more frequently and reduced their electricity usage by 18.4% relative to the control group. Households in the monetary group did not significantly alter their usage. These results about revealed preferences are contrasted with stated preferences disclosed in a survey of urban Indians who describe money, not health, as the main motivation for energy conservation.

Recent studies link the success of energy-feedback methods to the level of occupant engagement with people in their social circles and the resulting peer pressure to conform to certain social norms. Despite promising results, the literature remains limited in scope to individual rather than groups of buildings. This has limited the design of feedback initiatives leveraging social connections that exist, or that can be induced, within and between buildings. The current paper addresses the identified gap by proposing a multilayer agent-based model that serves as a test bed to simulate and optimize feedback methods applied on any building stock (e.g.,community and city). Monte Carlo and sensitivity analyses show that connecting occupants of different buildings, while increasing their engagement with the feedback mechanism, can lead to energy reductions exceeding 10%. The findings confirm the role of social networks in energy-conservation diffusion, setting the stage for large-scale and socially engaging energy-conservation initiatives.

It has been shown, that an effective way to achieve energy saving in that sector, is by providing consumers with information and feedback. This measure increases home inhabitants' awareness that leads to behavioral changes, and could help reduce energy consumption between 15% and 25% in some cases. Inhabitants' energy use awareness is also crucial for the success of demand response programs; one of the most important features of smart-grid adoption for the current and upcoming smart cities. The effects of different feedback strategies and information devices in households located in different cities in Sweden have been evaluated in this paper, since the impact on users' behavior of this feedback information vary depending on the way it is provided. Mobile text messages (SMSs) and digital displays placed in the building's common areas did not cause any noticeable behavioral changes, while the use of a TV channel and personal in-home displays were the most popular devices amongst households with high incomes. This paper concluded that even though feedback helped reduce domestic energy consumption and induce behavioral changes, it only reaches the consumers interested in it. It is important therefore to provide customized information to the consumer and select precise feedback tools for specific household groups. Special attention should be paid to increasing the energy consumption awareness in households with low income levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The questionnaire was formed by three groups of questions which concerned residents' characteristics, type and usage of electrical appliances, and attitudes towards energy consumption. The results show that electricity consumption profile of individual household can be mostly related to a given parameter. For example, the total household's income resulted one of the important factors determining the consumer behavior and as a rule is related to higher electricity consumption.

Firstly, a natural gas price sensitivity function has been explored according to gas consumption characteristics of residential users, which establishes the residential users demand response model from the perspective of consumer psychology. Secondly, a TOU pricing multi-agent simulation system has been developed, which mainly includes a government agent, a gas operator agent, and seven residential user agents of different income level. Finally, this study takes Zhengzhou city in China as an example to simulate the dynamic change process of running states in the UGPN (Urban Gas Pipeline Network) under the residential users TOU pricing policy. The simulation results indicate that the maximum peak-valley load difference can be reduced by 11.12%, given the residential users' response to TOU tariffs, by shifting load and electricity substitution. The TOU price also increases benefits of gas operators, and reduces residential consumers' energy expenditure. Furthermore, the small ratio of the residential users' consumption will lead to the low peak valley load difference, but poor peak shaving efficiency and little gas operators' benefits. In addition, the expenditure on energy changes among different kinds of consumers; that is, the high and low income households have a large increased ratio, while the middle income households have a low increased ratio.

Energy demand can be reduced by behavioral change; devices can support this by giving feedback to consumers on their behavior. One such feedback device, called the 'CO2 meter', shows indoor air-quality in the colors of a traffic light to motivate so called 'shock ventilation', which is energy efficient ventilation behavior. The following effects of the 'CO2 meter' are analyzed: (1) the effect of the device on ventilation behavior within households, (2) the diffusion of 'CO2 meter' to other households, and (3) the diffusion of changed behavior to households that do not adopt a 'CO2 meter'. An agent-based model of these processes for the city of Bottrop (Germany) was developed using a variety of data sources.

Using path analyses, variables in a values-based framework are used to predict surveyed behaviours. Findings indicate that behaviours hypothesized to be unplanned were not well predicted by the values-based framework. The framework successfully predicted what was hypothesized to be a fully reasoned behaviour. Three potential reasons are discussed for the lack of prediction of some behaviours.

There have been many debates on energy efficiency, system costs and relative payback period of DX-GSHP against ASHP systems over the past few years. In this context, and with the aim of enriching this debate, a detailed screening heat pump model previously developed is modified and used to compare the seasonal performance of ASHP vs DX-GSHP in a residential building in the cold climate city of Montreal. Further, a life cycle cost analysis is performed to account for the difference between initial and 10-year operating costs of the two systems based on the current prices in Quebec. The obtained results show that by proper sizing, energy consumption of the DX-GSHP system can be reduced by 50%. Moreover, with current borehole installation prices, the relative payback period of the GSHP (ground source heat pump) compared to ASHP is more than 15 years. However, if the borehole installation price reduced by 50% the payback period would be reduced to just a few years. Such results highlight the importance of further investigations in the area of DX-GSHPs, in order to reduce the borehole installation cost and increase its performance.

The performance of lead-acid (PbA) and lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery systems in combination with PV generation for a single home in Switzerland is studied using a time-dependant analysis. Firstly, the economic benefits of the two battery types are analysed for three different types of tariffs, i.e. a dynamic tariff based on the wholesale market (one price per hour for every day of the year), a flat rate and time-of-use tariff with two periods. Secondly, the reduction of battery capacity and annual discharge throughout the battery lifetime are simulated for PbA and Li-ion batteries. It was found that despite the levelised value of battery systems reaches up to 28% higher values with the dynamic tariff compared to the flat rate tariff, the levelised cost increases by 94% for the dynamic tariff, resulting in lower profitability.

Battery storage connected to solar PV (photovoltaic) array would reduce these effects in the presence of alternative price tariffs that incentivise households to shift load and reduce the peak demand. This challenge is addressed using a choice-diffusion model to forecast PV and battery storage uptake to 2025 for a case study in Townsville, Australia. Sensitivity of uptake is tested for six different price tariffs based on flat, time-of-use and critical-peak-pricing. Uptake of battery storage connected to solar PV ranged between 3% and 5.4% of households at 2025, depending on the price tariff, with the larger PV/battery options being more popular. Percentage of households disconnecting from the grid at 2025 is in the order of one percent depending on the price tariff. A sensitivity analysis showed battery price was a major driver to uptake whilst typical financial subsidies to purchase price have a lower effect. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The chamber is assembled using hollow acrylic walls whose sizes are tailored according to the required space. A thin layer of vacuum insulation plate (VIP) with an ultralow thermal conductivity coefficient is adhered around the inner walls so as to prevent heat exchange with room air. A high-precision temperature sensor measuring the temperature near the instrument's measuring point provides a feedback signal to a proportional integral derivative (PID) controller. Thermoelectric coolers uniformly arranged on the ceiling of the chamber are used to cool the air inside the chamber directly without any air supply system, yielding a vibration-free cooling system. A programmable power supply is used as the driver for the coolers to generate different cooling capacities. In practice, the down-flowing cool air and the up-flowing hot air form a natural convection, and the air temperature in the chamber gradually becomes stable and finally reaches the temperature set by the PID controller. Experimental results show that the system's steady-state error is 0.0043 degrees C on average, and the variation range is less than +/- 0.02 degrees C when the set temperature is 20 degrees C, which is much better than the requirement of a Class I standard room.

Quality of service (QoS) is the predominant metric of choice to manage resources among contending applications. Resource allocation policies to support static QoS for applications do not reflect the changing demands of the user in contemporary network on chip (NoC) based embedded architectures. User satisfaction with the user interactions and user interface design ought to be the primary design driver. Some recent research has integrated a saturating, non-linear user satisfaction function in the application thread scheduler. The application and operating system level user satisfaction research assumes that the throughput of inter-thread edges is limited only by the computational constraints of the nodes. With NoC, however, NoC resource allocation policies play an important role in determining the inter-thread communication flow's throughput and the resulting application level user satisfaction.

The growing demand for electricity has presented new opportunities for residential load scheduling systems to improve energy consumption by shifting or curtailing the demand required with respect to price change or emergency cases. In this paper, a dynamic residential load scheduling system (DRIS) is proposed for optimal scheduling of household appliances on the basis of an adaptive consumption level (CL) pricing scheme (ACLPS). The proposed load scheduling system encourages customers to manage their energy consumption within the allowable consumption allowance (CA) of the proposed DR pricing scheme to achieve lower energy bills. Simulation results show that employing the proposed DRLS system benefits the customers by reducing their energy bill and the utility companies by decreasing the peak load of the aggregated load demand. For a given case study, the proposed residential load scheduling system based on ACLPS allows customers to reduce their energy bills by up to 53% and to decrease the peak load by up to 35%.

The material produces efficient emission even under sunlight exposure, a feature pointing toward suitability for luminescent solar concentrators and UV light sensing, which is demonstrated for intensities as low as 200 nW/cm(2).

In process systems, energy demand management through production scheduling is an increasingly important tool that has the potential to provide significant economic and operational benefits by promoting the responsiveness of the process operation and its interactions with the utility providers. However, the dynamic behavior of the underlying process, especially during process transitions, is seldom taken into account as part of the DR problem formulation. Furthermore, the incorporation of energy constraints related to electricity pricing and energy resource availability presents an additional challenge. The goal of this study is to present a novel optimization formulation for energy demand management in process systems that accounts explicitly for transition behaviors and costs, subject to time-sensitive electricity prices and uncertainties in renewable energy resources. The proposed formulation brings together production scheduling and closed-loop control, and is realized through a real-time or receding-horizon optimization framework depending on the underlying operational scenarios. The dynamic formulation is cast as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem based on a proposed discretization approach, and its merits are demonstrated using a simulated continuous stirred tank reactor where the energy required is assumed to be roughly proportional to the material flow.

However, the physical mechanism(s) by which the directed flow of kinetic energy is thermalized throughout the ICM core remains unclear. We examine one widely discussed mechanism whereby the AGN induces subsonic turbulence in the ambient medium, the dissipation of which provides the ICM heat source. Through controlled inviscid three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we verify that explosive AGN-like events can launch gravity waves (g-modes) into the ambient ICM, which in turn decays to volume-filling turbulence. In our model, however, this process is found to be inefficient, with less than 1% of the energy injected by the AGN activity actually ending up in the turbulence of the ambient ICM. This efficiency is an order of magnitude or more too small to explain the observations of AGN-feedback in galaxy clusters and groups with short central cooling times. Atmospheres in which the g-modes are strongly trapped/confined have an even lower efficiency since, in these models, the excitation of turbulence relies on the g-modes' ability to escape from the center of the cluster into the bulk ICM.

Moreover, it is not trivial to identify a univocal parameter to evaluate the plant performance. For instance, cost evaluation clearly responds to an industrial view of the energy supply problem, while energy consumption or polluting emissions comply with a socio economic approach. In this scenario, the optimization of the plant management is a valuable instrument to gain insight on their behavior as the control strategy is varied, as well as to promote the distributed generation development, by maximizing the plants performances.

It induces additional regulations in grid power balancing because of lacking abilities of responding to grid issues such as reducing grid peak consumption or avoiding undesired injections. The smart grid implementation, which is designed to meet these requirements, is facilitated by microgrids development. This paper presents a DC microgrid (PV array, storage, power grid connection, DC load) with multi-layer supervision control which handles instantaneous power balancing following the power flow optimization while providing interface for smart grid communication. The optimization takes into account forecast of PV power production and load power demand, while satisfying constraints such as storage capability, grid power limitations, grid time-of-use pricing and grid peak hour. Optimization, whose efficiency is related to the prediction accuracy, is carried out by mixed integer linear programming. Experimental results show that the proposed microgrid structure is able to control the power flow at near optimum cost and ensures self-correcting capability. It can respond to issues of performing peak shaving, avoiding undesired injection, and making full use of locally produced energy with respect to rigid element constraints. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

With hourly metering of individual customers, data for individual consumption profiles have become available. Looking into these data we show that consumption profiles for specific categories of customers are equally systematic but quite distinct for different categories of customers. That is, different categories of customers contribute quite differently to the aggregated load profile. Coupling consumption profiles with hourly market prices which also include a systematic component in the hourly variation, we show that customers with different consumption profiles experience different average cost of their electricity consumption when billed according to hourly time-of-use prices. Thus, some categories of customers stand to gain from time-of-use pricing, while others stand to lose. In Denmark, typically industry, private services and households stand to lose, whereas agriculture and public services stand to gain from time-of-use pricing. However, differences within categories of customers are considerable and, for example, industrial companies running 24 h a day tend to gain from a time-of-use pricing.

Time-of-use pricing is very popular with economists, and many researchers have been written estimating and exploring the optimal time-of-use pricing for electricity markets. Yet, such pricing has rarely been used in the natural gas sector. In this paper, we propose an optimal time-of-use pricing in urban gas market based on an evolutionary game-theoretic perspective. As the urban gas market is a nonlinear complex economic system with several interacting agents, we use a multi-agent system comprising a government agent, a local gas distribution operator agent, and different types of end-user agents. A power structure demand response program is employed to simulate the user demand response. A mixed-integer linear programming is formulated to determine the time-of-use price-signal delivering maximum gas operator profit and the optimal load pattern for end-users. In an illustrative example, we simulate and compare the time-of-use block prices and time of-use hourly prices with traditional fixed pricing using real-world data of Wuhan in China. The numerical results indicate that time-of-use pricing schedules have significant potential for peak-shaving and load-shifting for urban gas pipeline network systems and would thus lower operating costs. Furthermore, different gas users exhibit different demand responsiveness intensity. Finally, we evaluate the impact on total social welfare of regulation scenarios and find that welfare decreases with deregulation, implying that the urban gas market is immature and reasonable regulation is still necessary.

When the same battery chemistry can arguably be used in either a flow or static electrode design, the relative merits of either design choice become of interest. Here, we analyze the costs of the electro-chemically active stack for both architectures under the constraint of constant energy efficiency and charge and discharge rates, using as case studies the aqueous-vanadium-redox chemistry, widely used in conventional flow batteries, and aqueous lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP)/lithium-titanium-phosphate (LTP) suspensions, an example of a higher energy density suspension-based electrode. It is found that although flow batteries always have a cost advantage ($ kWh(-1)) at the stack level modeled, the advantage is a strong function of flow electrode energy density. For the LFP/LTP case, the cost advantages decreases from similar to 50% to similar to 10% over experimentally reasonable ranges of suspension loading.

These design variables include indoor set point temperature, degrees of setback temperature in cooling mode, building thermal mass, and air exchange rate for each climate zone.

Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) - in most climates - embodies the single largest draw inside our buildings. In many countries around the world a concerted effort is being made towards retrofitting existing buildings to improve energy efficiency. Better windows, insulation, and ducting can make drastic differences in the energy consumption of a building HVAC system. Even with these improvements, HVAC systems are still required to compensate for daily and seasonal temperature swings of the surrounding environment. Thermal mass inside the thermal envelope can help to alleviate these swings. While it is possible to add specialty thermal mass products to buildings for this purpose, commercial uptake of these products is low.

Analyses focused on household electricity consumption in the first week following deployment, and again over a 3-month time span. Findings showed that households receiving simple feedback, and feedback framed as cost did not differ significantly from the randomized control at either the 1-week or the 3-month time points. Similarly, results showed that educational materials alone did not reduce electricity consumption. However, significant effects were found for households receiving the normative frame, which consumed 9% less than control households during the initial 1-week evaluation period, and 7% less during the full 3-month evaluation period. Yet despite these findings, residents reported more positive experiences and more obligations to conserve electricity with the cost and feedback IHDs.

This strategy can be exploited by customers in presence of dynamic pricing schemes, such as hourly electricity prices, where the customer electricity cost may vary at any hour of day, and power consumption can be managed in a more flexible and economical manner, taking advantage of the price differential. Instead of modifying their energy consumption, customers can install storage systems to reduce their electricity bill, shifting the energy consumption from on-peak to off-peak hours. This paper develops a detailed storage model linking together technical, economic and electricity market parameters. The proposed operating strategy aims to maximize the profit of the storage owner (electricity customer) under simplifying assumptions, by determining the optimal charge/discharge schedule. The model can be applied to several kinds of storages, although the simulations refer to three kinds of batteries: lead-acid, lithium-ion (Li-ion) and sodium-sulfur (NaS) batteries. Unlike literature reviews, often requiring an estimate of the end-user load profile, the proposed operation strategy is able to properly identify the battery-charging schedule, relying only on the hourly price profile, regardless of the specific facility's consumption, thanks to some simplifying assumptions in the sizing and the operation of the battery. This could be particularly useful when the customer load profile cannot be scheduled with sufficient reliability, because of the uncertainty inherent in load forecasting.

On markets where there is no substantial feed-in support for renewables, there is also an economic incentive for PV self-consumption, as selling prices for PV electricity are normally lower than retail electricity prices. One option for improved self-consumption is rescheduling of programmable appliances, typically washing machines, clothes dryers and dishwashers. This paper determines the potential to increase PV self-consumption through scheduling of these appliances in Swedish single-family buildings. Simulations of daily load scheduling were performed to match on-site PV power generation and recent (2008-2012) hourly electricity market prices, using a set of high-resolution (10-min) appliance load profiles from 200 monitored Swedish households. Since these data provide appliance ownership and daily appliance use patterns in a wide range of households, a realistic upper limit to the self-consumption potential is obtained. The conclusions are that load shifting can potentially increase PV self-consumption by around 200 kW h on average, corresponding to a few percent of the total PV power generation for the system sizes studied (3-9 kW). The maximum economic benefit over the studied years was 20 EUR per year and household. For the larger PV system sizes that could inject critical peak powers to the distribution grid, the peak hourly PV surplus decreased less than a few percent. The main conclusion is that there is an overall low potential for improved self-consumption through optimal scheduling of the studied appliances, at least with the current Swedish market conditions.

The requirements for the PLS-II linac to achieve the top-up injection are very demanding because it is a full energy injector with a very limited energy margin. One of the requirements is to ensure high injection efficiency in order to minimize the beam loss at the storage ring injection point and the experimental hall during injection because loss leads to a high radiation level in the experimental hall. The energy stability and energy spread of the accelerated electron beam are fundamental parameters to monitor and manage for high injection efficiency. An energy feedback system consisting of a stripline-type beam position monitor and the last klystron was implemented. To diagnose the injected beam's energy and energy spread in real time during top-up mode injection, we installed an optical transition radiation (OTR) monitor system upstream of the beam transport line (BTL) after the first bending magnet. The energy and the energy spread ranges can be controlled with a horizontal slit installed after the OTR monitor.

Hence, this empirical study set out with the intention of estimating the extent of response to a demand-based time-of-use electricity distribution tariff among Swedish single-family homes in the long term. The results show that six years after the implementation households still respond to the price signals of the tariff by cutting demand in peak hours and shifting electricity consumption from peak to off-peak hours.

Include the possibility that conformational dynamics may be coupled to chemical reactions, where multiscale (i.e., QM/MM) methods are needed, and this task becomes even more daunting. Methods: Free energy simulations (i.e., molecular dynamics), multiscale modeling, and reweighting schemes. Results: Herein, we present two new approaches for mitigating the aforementioned challenges. The first is a new chain-of-replica method (off-path simulations, OPS) for computing potentials of mean force (PMFs) along an easily defined reaction coordinate. This development is coupled with a new distributed, highly-parallel replica framework (REPDstr) within the CHARMM package. Validation of these new schemes is carried out on two processes that undergo conformational changes. First is the simple torsional rotation of butane, while a much more challenging glycosidic rotation (in vacuo and solvated) is the second. Additionally, a new approach that greatly improves (i.e., possibly an order of magnitude) the efficiency of computing QM/MM PMFs is introduced and compared to standard schemes. Our efforts are grounded in the recently developed method for efficiently computing QM-based free energies (i.e., QM-Non-Boltzmann Bennett, QM-NBB). Again, we validate this new technique by computing the QM/MM PMF of butane's torsional rotation. Conclusions: The OPS-REPDstr method is a promising new approach that overcomes many limitations of standard pathway simulations in CHARMM. The combination of QM-NBB with pathway techniques is very promising as it offers significant advantages over current procedures.

Moreover, as renewable energy sources are deployed in home, a home energy management system needs to consider both energy consumption and generation simultaneously to minimize the energy cost. In this paper, a smart home energy management model has been presented in which electrical and thermal appliances are jointly scheduled. The proposed method aims at minimizing the electricity cost of a residential customer by scheduling various type of appliances considering the residents consumption behavior, seasonal probability, social random factor, discomfort index and appliances starting probability functions. In this model, the home central controller receives the electricity price information, environmental factors data as well as the resident desired options in order to optimally schedule appliances including electrical and thermal. The scheduling approach is tested on a typical home including variety of home appliances, a small wind turbine, photovoltaic panel, combined heat and power unit, boiler and electrical and thermal storages over a 24-h period. The results show that the scheduling of different appliances can be reached simultaneously by using the proposed formulation. Moreover, simulation results evidenced that the proposed home energy management model exhibits a lower cost and, therefore, is more economical. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These programs are tailored to offer monetary incentives to electricity customers so that they voluntarily consume electricity in an efficient way. Thus, DSM presents households with numerous opportunities to lower their electricity bills. However, systems that combine the various DSM strategies with a view to maximizing energy management benefits have not received sufficient attention. This study therefore proposes an intelligent energy management framework that can be used to implement both energy storage and appliance scheduling schemes. By adopting appliance scheduling, customers can realize cost savings by appropriately scheduling their power consumption during the low peak hours. More savings could further be achieved through smart electricity storage. Power storage allows electricity consumers to purchase power during off-peak hours when electricity prices are low and satisfy their demands when prices are high by discharging the batteries. For optimal cost savings, the customers must constantly monitor the price fluctuations in order to determine when to switch between the utility grid and the electricity storage devices. However, with a high penetration of consumer owned storage devices, the charging of the batteries must be properly coordinated and appropriately scheduled to avoid creating new peaks.

Based on a reduced-order modeling strategy and an economic model predictive control approach, we analyze the effects of the community of homes responding optimally to variations in wholesale market electricity prices.

We also consider centralized and decentralized strategies for minimizing the peak demand of the community. For this simulated community, we find that centralized, coordinated control of residential air conditioning systems reduces overall peak by 8.8% but increases total energy consumption by 133%. Decentralized control reduces overall peak by 5.7%, demonstrating that the value of information sharing for peak reduction is 3.1%.

Electrical power storage provides a viable solution to managing power supply and electrical loads as well as unexpected imbalances. Electricity suppliers could deploy electricity storage facilities at various levels of the smart grid system: generation, transmission, substations and residential level. Storage would significantly address the power quality and reliability problems through peak shaving and frequency control. It also reduces the need for huge infrastructural expenditures by making them more efficient. At the residential level, smart storage together with dynamic pricing in the deregulated electricity markets presents the electricity suppliers with a strategy to achieve grid stability. In this paper, we consider a smart grid environment with a high penetration of households' storage batteries. By using an appropriate electricity price structure, the electricity supplier influences households' electricity consumption. On the other hand, the households aim to minimize their electricity bills by capitalizing on price fluctuation to schedule their electrical appliances and coordinate the charging and discharging of their batteries. The electricity supplier has a dynamic power limit for each hour that must not be exceeded by the hourly aggregate load of the households. Further, we assume that in supplying electrical power, the households' electrical devices are given priority over their storage devices. The policy is such that batteries will be charged by the residual power after the appliances loads have been satisfied.

The methodology is valid for any kind of storage, but it has been used for lead-acid or Li-ion batteries, technologies that could be applied in any kind of building (residential, commercial, or industrial).

The results show that even given a Spanish TOU special for electric vehicles (with a great difference between on-peak and off-peak prices of 0.135 (sic)/kW h), at the present cost of battery storage (battery bank + bidirectional inverter + control), the storage system is not profitable for the consumer. For the battery system to be economically profitable, the costs of batteries would need to be reduced to about 0.05 (sic)/kW h(cycled) in the case of low-efficiency lead acid batteries (with bi-di converter of 700 (sic)/kW) or to 0.075 (sic)/kW h(cycled) in the case of efficient Li-ion batteries (with bi-di converter of 300 (sic)/kW). The most critical parameters are the acquisition cost of the battery bank and the number of cycles to failure, which determine the acquisition cost of the battery bank per kW h cycled.

In terms of fast charge extraction and suppression of bimolecular recombination, elaborate interface design in low bandgap OSCs is of significance to further boost their ultimate efficiency. In this work, a facile solution-processed functionalized single wall carbon nanotube (f-SWCNT) mesh/self-assembled molecule (SAM) hybrid structure is reported as hole transport layer (HTL) in low bandgap OSCs. The effectiveness of such hybrid HTL originates from two aspects: (i) SAM layer can effectively realize Ohmic contact between f-SWCNT and low bandgap polymer donors with deep-lying HOMO levels due to the reduction of interface energy barrier; (ii) f-SWCNT mesh can provide fast hole extraction pathways to quickly sweep out photogenerated charges. As a consequence of synergic effects of such hybrid HTL, both photocurrent and fill factor are greatly enhanced due to the reduced bimolecular recombination. Together with careful light management by using ZnO optical spacer, a high efficiency of 10.5% has been achieved.

Our mixed and hard embedded NoCs add only similar to 1% area to large FPGAs and can run much faster than the core logic, thus keeping up with the speed of I/O and memory interfaces. A detailed power analysis, per NoC component, shows that routers consume 14x less power when implemented hard compared with soft, and whether hard or soft most of the router's power is consumed in the input modules for buffering. For complete systems, hard NoCs consume <6% (and as low as 3%) of the FPGA's dynamic power budget to support 100 GB/s of communication bandwidth. We find that, depending on design choices, hard NoCs consume 4.5-10.4 mJ of energy per gigabyte of data transferred.

In real situations, a direct and feedback coupling between the excitation source and the system must always exist at a certain level. This manifestation of the law of conservation of energy is known as the Sommerfeld effect. In the case of obtaining a mathematical model for such a system, additional equations are usually necessary to describe the vibration sources with limited power and its coupling with the mechanical system. In this work, a cantilever beam and a non-ideal DC motor fixed to its free end are analyzed. The motor has an unbalanced mass that provides excitation to the system which is proportional to the current applied to the motor. During the coast up operation of the motor, if the drive power is increased slowly, making the excitation frequency pass through the first natural frequency of the beam, the DC motor speed will remain the same until it suddenly jumps to a much higher value (simultaneously its amplitude jumps to a much lower value) upon exceeding a critical input power. It was found that the Sommerfeld effect depends on some system parameters and the motor operational procedures. These parameters are explored to avoid the resonance capture in the Sommerfeld effect.

For dynamic balance of the robot, we design a pattern generator based on the ZMP (Zero-Moment Point) criterion. In comparison to the conventional bent-knee walking pattern, the proposed walking pattern involves three-dimensional motion of the upper body. With the proposed walking pattern the robot can walk with almost stretched knees at low and medium walking speeds. This paper also presents a body posture control method.

Therefore, the feasibility and the resulting potential of coupling the electricity grid with the thermal supply of residential buildings is analysed in this paper. Thereby, inexpensive and widespread thermal storage capacities could be used to,improve the integration of dynamic renewable electricity generation. In this paper the technical and economical key impact factors for such thermal DSM approach are elaborated. Based on a literature review, the identified key factors are aggregated to form consistent scenarios of the German ""Energiewende"" (turnaround in energy policy). The practicability and possible magnitude of the intended DSM is then analysed based on the identified scenarios. All resulting scenarios highlight the growing demand for a flexible electricity market. Especially in scenarios with strong growth of renewable electricity generation, up to 45 GW of flexible electric capacities would be required in Germany by the year 2030. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that independently of the energy market development, it is very likely that electricity coupled supply systems will continuously have installed capacities of at least 14 GW. It is found that especially the strong dissemination of smart metering and smart control infrastructure is crucial to incorporate these capacities into DSM activities. Furthermore, the necessity and the resulting benefits of residential end-user participation in the electricity market need to be communicated to all stakeholders to ensure the availability and acceptance of dynamic pricing schemes in the future.

Design/methodology/approach - The problem of energy flow management is formulated and solved as an optimization problem using a linear programming model. The total energy cost of the consumer is optimized. The optimal values of decision variables are found using CPLEX solver. Findings - The simulation results demonstrated that if the optimal decisions are made regarding the V2H operation and managing the produced power by solar panels then the total energy payments are significantly reduced. Originality/value - The gap that the proposed model is trying to fill is the holistic determination of an optimal energy procurement portfolio by using various embedded resources in an optimal way. The contributions of this paper are in threefold as: first, the introduction of mobile storage devices with a periodical availability depending on driving schedules; second, offering a new business model for managing the generation of PV modules by considering the possibility of grid injection or self-consumption; third, considering Real Time Pricing in the suggested formulation.",,,False,,,808727,,2018-06-15 09:57:14.799743+00:00,0,False,,,Optimal household energy management using V2H flexibilities,False,,,True,

The improved consumption feedback provided, and in particular, the installation of in-house displays, has been shown to significantly reduce residential electricity demand in some international trials. This paper attempts to uncover the underlying drivers of such information-led reductions by exploring two research questions. First, does feedback improve a household's stock of information about potential energy reducing behaviours? And second, do improvements in such information help explain the demand reductions associated with the introduction of smart metering and time-of-use tariffs? Data is from a randomised controlled smart metering trial (Ireland) which also collected extensive information on household attitudes towards energy conservation and self-reported stocks of information related to energy saving. As with previous results in Ireland, we find that participation in a smart metering programme with time-of-use tariffs significantly reduces demand. Although treated households also increased their selfreported energy-reducing information, such improvements are not correlated with demand reductions in the short-run. Given this result, it is possible that feedback and other information provided in the context of smart metering are mainly effective in reducing and shifting demand because they act as a reminder and motivator.

In many manufacturing systems, it is sometimes possible to temporarily switch off a machine to reserve energy, and switch it back on when a certain condition is met. Indeed, production control-based shop floor continuous improvement is recognised as one of the most cost-effective ways to achieve energy-efficient production. In this paper, we study serial production lines with Bernoulli machines and finite capacity buffers and assume that some of the machines in the line can be switched on and off during the production process according to a state-based feedback control policy. Mathematical models for the system under consideration are derived and analytical methods are developed for calculating the system performance measures during transients. Specifically, exact Markovian analysis is used for two- and three-machine lines in which the switch-on/off operations of only one machine is considered. For longer lines, the switch-on/off operations of multiple machines are considered and an aggregation-based approximation approach is applied to evaluate the system performance measures.

The present study evaluated whether feedback-induced variability on wheelchair propulsion technique variables would also enhance the motor learning process. Learning was operationalized as an improvement in mechanical efficiency and propulsion technique, which are thought to be closely related during the learning process. Methods 17 Participants received visual feedback-based practice (feedback group) and 15 participants received regular practice (natural learning group). Both groups received equal practice dose of 80 min, over 3 weeks, at 0.24 W/kg at a treadmill speed of 1.11 m/s. To compare both groups the pre- and post-test were performed without feedback. The feedback group received real-time visual feedback on seven propulsion variables with instruction to manipulate the presented variable to achieve the highest possible variability (1st 4-min block) and optimize it in the prescribed direction (2nd 4-min block). To increase motor exploration the participants were unaware of the exact variable they received feedback on. Energy consumption and the propulsion technique variables with their respective coefficient of variation were calculated to evaluate the amount of intra-individual variability. Results The feedback group, which practiced with higher intra-individual variability, improved the propulsion technique between pre- and post-test to the same extent as the natural learning group. Mechanical efficiency improved between pre- and post-test in the natural learning group but remained unchanged in the feedback group. Conclusion These results suggest that feedback-induced variability inhibited the improvement in mechanical efficiency. Moreover, since both groups improved propulsion technique but only the natural learning group improved mechanical efficiency, it can be concluded that the improvement in mechanical efficiency and propulsion technique do not always appear simultaneously during the motor learning process. Their relationship is most likely modified by other factors such as the amount of the intra-individual variability.",,,False,,,808735,,2018-06-08 12:29:53.503704+00:00,0,False,,,Effects of Visual Feedback-Induced Variability on Motor Learning of Handrim Wheelchair Propulsion,False,,,True,

In contrast to the real-time pricing or peak load pricing DR programs, CIDR continues to offer a flat rate to retail customers and also provides them with voluntary incentives to induce demand response. Theoretical analysis shows the benefits of the proposed scheme in terms of social welfare, consumer surplus, LSE profit, the robustness of the retail electricity rate, and readiness for implementation.

However, little is known about consumer demand for different approaches to achieving DSR. This study aimed to gauge the acceptability of a range of DSR tariffs, and explore factors affecting it. An online between-subjects survey experiment was deployed to a representative sample of bill payers in Great Britain (N = 2002), testing five tariffs including static/dynamic time of use (TOU) pricing (with/ without automated response to price changes) and direct load control (DLC) of heating on a below-average flat rate. The tariff permitting limited DLC of heating was significantly (p < .01) more popular than the TOU tariffs. This was surprising given evidence for concern around loss of control in DLC, and suggests that for many people DLC is acceptable in principle (within tight bounds and with override ability). The option of automated response made dynamic TOU (otherwise the least popular tariff) as acceptable as static TOU. This is important because dynamic TOU offers additional network benefits, while automation can improve duration and reliability of response. The TOU tariffs were rated highly for giving people control over spending on electricity, but other factors were more associated with overall acceptance. (C) 2015 The Authors.

To reduce consumption much work has been done investigating behavioral energy-use interventions (e.g.,feedback). Being able to accurately identify effective interventions for specific buildings or communities of buildings based on local conditions has significant implications for reducing energy consumption and demand in buildings. Therefore, recently researchers have begun developing predictive models of these behavioral interventions. However, limited consideration has been given to the importance that modeling assumptions (regarding social network type and structure) have in determining impact on intervention outcome. In this paper, an integrated model that combines established social-psychological principles of social influence and cultural norm diffusion with building social network profiles is developed and tested to examine the effect of social network type and structure on interventions. The writers apply agent-based modeling to simulate the interactions of heterogeneous building occupants in their respective social networks to examine the importance of social network type and structure for two interventions, as follows: (1)installing a peer energy-use feedback system, and (2)installing a feedback system and inserting an intervening agent into the building. The results indicate that network type and structure can have a significant effect on the time required for occupant energy-use intervention outcomes to reach a state of equilibrium. Thus, when modeling and selecting behavioral interventions, expected interventions outcomes should not be assumed based solely on generalized results from other studies, but consideration must be given to specific social network properties.",,,False,,,808742,,2018-07-09 11:58:02.350622+00:00,0,False,,,Impact of Social Network Type and Structure on Modeling Normative Energy Use Behavior Interventions,False,,,True,

In Monitor-While-Drilling (MWD), the information available for coal detection are limited to a small set of drilling parameters that can be measured on a rotary drill rig. Despite this constraint, our analysis shows that MWD can still detect the top of the coal seam consistently without relying on geophysical data such as bulk density and natural gamma by using the SEM measure. The proposal utilizes a hypothesized link between a derived drill performance indicator (the rotation-to-thrust power ratio) and geomechanical properties of sedimentay rock strata (shear and compressive strengths) to increase the coal discriminative power of SEM relative to Teale's specific energy measure. Its efficacy is demonstrated using mutual information, a simple threshold strategy and an artificial neural network. The results show the SEM can detect the coal seam interface consistently with a greater margin for error, and overcome the problems of low specificity and high variability observed in existing MWD approaches. By reducing the detection uncertainty, the SEM is able to provide consistent feedback while drilling and eliminate trial-and-error.

The pilot ran during the summers of 2008 and 2009 and was called the Smart Energy Pricing (SEP) Pilot. In 2008, it tested two types of dynamic pricing tariffs: critical peak pricing (CPP) and peak time rebate (PTR) tariffs. About a thousand customers were randomly placed on these tariffs and some of them were paired with one of two enabling technologies, a device known as the Energy Orb and a switch for cycling central air conditioners. The usage of a randomly chosen control group of customers was also monitored during the same time period. In 2009, BGE repeated the pilot program with the same customers who participated in the 2008 pilot, but this time it only tested the PTR tariff.

In addition, we report average peak demand reduction for each of the treatment cells in the SEP pilot and compare the findings with those reported from earlier pilots. These results show conclusively that it is possible to incentivize customers to reduce their peak period loads using price signals.

Very generally speaking, biological neural systems rely on a large number of relatively simple, slow and unreliable processing elements and obtain performance and robustness from a massively parallel principle of operation and a high level of redundancy where the failure of single elements usually does not induce any observable system performance degradation.

Compared with the energy price linkage method, the results show that the market netback value mechanism has a greater impact on the total social surplus. In order to achieve further low-carbon targets, the proportion of second and third tier residents can be expanded, while the energy prices could be deregulated to some degree. In addition, considering residential affordability, the government may take into account different electricity pricing mechanisms for different tiers of residents. Electricity pricing for the first tier, the second tier and the third tier should be based respectively on cost, the integration of energy price linkage and the market netback value mechanism.

Many efforts have been directed into the field of building design optimization concerning building energy performance, but most of the studies focus on residential buildings or public buildings. Very limited research results studying plants buildings have been reported. However, plants buildings have certain unique features that make the design problem more challenging. Furthermore, the approaches presented in the current publications could not guarantee the performance of their designs if the computation capacity is limited. This paper attempts to address these two issues. First, an EnergyPlus-integrated overall energy consumption estimation framework is developed for a class of manufacturing plants, where the environmental conditions would not affect the energy consumption of the production processes. Based on that, the building design problem for this type of manufacturing plants is formulated as a stochastic programming problem concerning uncertainties arising from the future weather conditions and energy prices, where seasonal production scheduling optimizing is incorporated when estimating the performance of building designs. Second, Ordinal Optimization (OO) method [1] is introduced to solve the problem so as to quantitatively guarantee a high probability of finding satisfactory designs while reducing the computation burden.

In this paper, we develop a model-based approach for designing oscillations that suppress turbulence in a channel flow. We utilize eddy-viscosity-enhanced linearization of the turbulent flow with control in conjunction with turbulence modelling to determine skin-friction drag in a simulation-free manner. The Boussinesq eddy viscosity hypothesis is used to quantify the effect of fluctuations on the mean velocity in flow subject to control. In contrast to the traditional approach that relies on numerical simulations, we determine the turbulent viscosity from the second-order statistics of the linearized model driven by white-in-time stochastic forcing. The spatial power spectrum of the forcing is selected to ensure that the linearized model for uncontrolled flow reproduces the turbulent energy spectrum. The resulting correction to the turbulent mean velocity induced by small-amplitude wall movements is then used to identify the optimal frequency of drag-reducing oscillations. In addition, the control net efficiency and the turbulent flow structures that we obtain agree well with the results of numerical simulations and experiments. This demonstrates the predictive power of our model-based approach to controlling turbulent flows and is expected to pave the way for successful flow control at higher Reynolds numbers than currently possible.",,,False,,,808776,,2018-06-15 10:02:50.297275+00:00,0,False,,,Model-based design of transverse wall oscillations for turbulent drag reduction,False,,,True,

APFs have been researched and put into practical use in power systems with nonlinear loads for harmonic current compensation, power factor correction, reactive power compensation and etc. Shunt APFs, connected in parallel with the power line, are more common than the series ones. This paper presents a bidirectional grid connected multi-input DC-AC converter that plays as a shunt APF integrated with Distributed Generation (DG) sources for power quality enhancement and supplying a part of loads. At the input port of this converter, Half Bridge Converters (HBC) is used to meet the requirement of different DGs, such as Photovoltaic (PV) and Fuel Cell (PC) systems and at the output port, a cycloconverter acts as a shunt APF to compensate current harmonics, reactive power of load and also supply a part of the load.

Unlike the traditional joint source-channel coding formalisms, no restrictions are imposed on the number of channel uses per source sample. For single-source memoryless point-to-point channels, E(D) is shown to be equal to the product of the minimum energy per bit E-bmin of the channel and the rate-distortion function R(D) of the source, regardless of whether channel output feedback is available at the transmitter. The primary focus is on Gaussian sources and channels affected by additive white Gaussian noise under quadratic distortion criteria, with or without perfect channel output feedback.

In order to preserve the concordance of feedback methods when using a more efficient time integration scheme as for instance the hierarchical time-step scheme we implement a modified version of the time-step limiter proposed by Saitoh & Makino. We apply the limiter to general test cases, and first show that this scheme violates energy conservation up to almost 4 orders of magnitude when energy is injected at random times. To tackle this issue, we find it necessary not only to ensure a fast information propagation, but also to enforce a prompt response of the system to the energy perturbation. The method proposed here to handle strong feedback events enables us to achieve energy conservation at per cent level in all tests, even if all the available energy is injected into only one particle.

Our experiments extend previous work by examining: (1) the effects of diurnal and seasonal variation of solar zenith angle and azimuth relative to incipient roughness features, (2) the evolution of roughness geometry in response to radiatively driven ablation and (3) the relative solar energy collection efficiencies of various roughness geometries and geographic locations and orientations. A notable result of this examination is that the time evolution of the aspect ratio of surface features under solar-driven ablation collapses onto a roughly universal curve that depends only on latitude, not the detailed shape of the feature. The total enhancement of surface melt relative to a smooth surface over a full ablation season varies with this ratio, and this dependence suggests a way to parameterize roughness effects in large-scale models that cannot treat individual roughness features.

We propose a variation on model predictive control to achieve this goal. When the right variables are used, the dynamics of the system are linear, and the constraints are convex. The cost function, however, is nonconvex due to the temperature dependence of thermodynamic efficiency. To handle this nonconvexity we propose a sequential convex optimisation method, which typically converges in fewer than 5 or so iterations. We employ a fast convex quadratic programming solver to carry out the iterations, which is more than fast enough to run in real time.

Objectives originating from the demands that are put on energy consumption, acoustical performance, thermal occupant comfort, indoor air quality and many other issues must all be reconciled. An assessment requires the use of predictive models that involve numerous design and physical parameters as their inputs. Since these input parameters, as well as the models that operate on them, are not precisely known, it is imprudent to assume deterministic values for them. A more realistic approach is to introduce ranges of uncertainty in the parameters themselves, or in their derivation, from underlying approximations. In so doing, it is recognized that the outcome of a performance assessment is influenced by many sources of uncertainty. As a consequence of this approach the design process is informed by assessment outcomes that produce probability distributions of a target measure instead of its deterministic value. In practice this may lead to a ""well informed"" analysis but not necessarily to a straightforward, cost effective and efficient design process. This paper discusses how design decision making can be based on uncertainty assessments. A case study is described focussing on a discrete decision that involves a choice between two HVAC system designs. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) including uncertainty information is used to arrive at a rational decision. In this approach, key performance indicators such as energy efficiency, thermal comfort and others are ranked according to their importance and preferences. This process enables a clear group consensus based choice of one of the two options. The research presents a viable means of collaboratively ranking complex design options based on stakeholder's preferences and considering the uncertainty involved in the designs.

However, allowing refrigerant to leave the evaporator without completely vaporizing risks catastrophic damage to the compressor, so superior control is required at low superheat levels.

This paper reveals how a particular control architecture inherently compensates for both the static and dynamic nonlinearities that dominate the valve-to superheat transient response. Furthermore, the control implementation only requires temperature measurements, which are frequently available in ordinary HVAC systems.

A feedback loop confined to the secondary of the inductive link adjusts the timing and conduction angle of switching to provide just the right amount of supply voltage needed for keeping the current-source voltage constant at or slightly above the compliance limit. Since drive is based on current rather than voltage, and supply-voltage update is near real-time, the quality of the current pulses is high regardless of how the electrode impedance evolves during stimulation. By scaling the switching frequency according to power demand, the technique further improves overall power consumption of the stimulator. The technique is implemented with a very simple control circuitry comprising a comparator, a Schmitt trigger and a logic gate of seven devices in addition to an on-chip switch and an off-chip capacitor. The power consumed by the proposed supply circuit itself is no larger than what the linear regulator of a conventional supply typically consumes for the same stimulation current. Still, the sum of supply and current-source power is typically between 20% and 75% of the conventional source power alone.

Air-conditioning and heating loads in residential buildings are major contributors to total electricity consumption. In hot climates, such as Austin, Texas, the electricity cooling load of buildings results in critical peak load during the on-peak period. Demand response (DR) is valuable to reduce both electricity loads and energy costs for end users in a residential building. This paper focuses on developing a control strategy for the HVACs to respond to real-time prices for peak load reduction. A proposed dynamic demand response controller (DDRC) changes the set-point temperature to control HVAC loads depending on electricity retail price published each 15 minutes and partially shifts some of this load away from the peak. The advantages of the proposed control strategy are that DDRC has a detailed scheduling function and compares the real-time retail price of electricity with a threshold price that customers set by their preference in order to control HVAC loads considering energy cost. In addition, a detailed single family house model is developed using OpenStudio and Energyplus considering the geometry of a residential building and geographical environment. This HVAC modeling provides simulation of a house. Comfort level is, moreover, reflected into the DDRC to minimize discomfort when DDRC changes the set-point temperature. Our proposed DDRC is implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK and connected to the EnergyPlus model via building controls virtual test bed (BCVTB). The real-time retail price is based on the real-time wholesale price in the ERCOT market in Texas.

Optimal modalities for decreasing this energy cost remain challenging. Excessive energy consumption, however, seems to be mainly due to extra positive muscle work to substantially lift the body's center of mass (CM) against gravity during the paretic limb swing. Objective. The authors tested a new rehabilitation strategy in a pilot study to specifically reduce the energy cost in hemiparetic gait. Methods. Six chronic hemiparetic patients underwent a 6-week gait training program on a treadmill with real-time feedback of their CM and were asked to reduce its increased vertical displacement. The authors assessed the walking energy cost, vertical CM displacement, kinematics, and electromyogram activity without feedback before and after treatment. Results. After treatment, the vertical CM displacement decreased by 10% (P = .005), particularly when the CM vaulted over the nonparetic limb in stance, and the energy cost decreased markedly by 30% (P = .009). The paretic knee flexion in swing increased concomitantly by 45% and muscle co-contraction decreased significantly in both thigh muscles by 15%. Conclusions. The rehabilitation approach followed in this study seems remarkably effective in decreasing the walking energy cost. By treating the compensatory strategy (ie, the increased CM displacement), we also appear to treat primary deviations such as poststroke knee impairments, which is novel and complementary to current concepts in rehabilitation.

Additionally, we compare these preferences against experimental data to determine whether people have insight into what information best works for an increased understanding of energy saving. Using a computer-based simulated IHD, we find that the types of feedback information that consumers prefer (appliance-specific and dollar-feedback) are not as effective for learning about appliance energy use as the less-preferred aggregated kW h feedback.

In particular, an regularization technique is proposed to deal with schedule-based appliances (SAs), for which their on/off statuses are governed by binary decision variables. By relaxing these variables from integer to continuous values, the problem is reformulated as a new CP problem with an additional regularization term in the objective.

First published February 1, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00984.2011.-Humans often appear to prefer movement patterns that minimize the metabolic energy expenditure of performing a task. However, it is not clear whether this preference is dependent on adaptation to feedback or results from a previously learned motor plan. We recently found that for a bouncing task with an identifiable neuromechanical resonant frequency, humans do not initially prefer to bounce at the resonant frequency despite its presumed metabolic benefits. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether humans adapt their preferred bouncing frequency over time to approach the metabolic optimum. Subjects (n = 12) performed a series of 6-min reclined bouncing trials while we quantified bounce frequency, metabolic rate, and rate of positive mechanical work performed on the body. In one trial, subjects bounced at their preferred frequency. In five other trials, subjects bounced at frequencies prescribed by a metronome to match specific percentages of their resonant frequency (80-120%). Positive mechanical work rate was held constant across trials by having subjects match real-time visual feedback to a target. The metabolic rate was lowest during prescribed frequency trials near resonance, not during the preferred frequency trial when subjects were free to choose the bouncing frequency. While the initial preferred frequency was lower than the resonant frequency, the preferred frequency gradually approached resonance over the course of 6 min. These results provide evidence that humans do not choose their preferred movement pattern based on an unchanging learned motor plan, but instead adapt their preferred frequency in response to feedback.

Here, we demonstrate how the forward flux sampling method (FFS) can be used to determine the thermal stability of magnets with general microstructures for time scales ranging from picoseconds to years. To apply FFS to magnetic systems, we first use the nudged elastic band (NEB) method to determine a minimum energy path connecting the initial with the final state of the magnetic transition. Interfaces defined based on this minimum energy path then provide the basis for the FFS procedure in which dynamical trajectories are generated by integrating a stochastic version of the fundamental equation of motion of the magnetization (Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation) at finite temperature. This approach allows to determine average lifetimes for incoherent reversal processes and it can be applied for any value of the damping constant.

NoCs have a significant impact on the system's performance, power and reliability. However, NoCs can be plagued by higher power consumption and degraded throughput if the network and router are not designed properly. Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel router architecture, where we tune the frequency of a router in response to network load to manage both performance and power. We propose three dynamic frequency tuning techniques, FreqBoost, FreqThrtl and FreqTune, targeted at congestion and power management in NoCs. We also propose and evaluate a novel fine-grained frequency tuning scheme where we vary the number of virtual-channels in a router dynamically. As a further optimization to these schemes, we propose a frequency tuning scheme where we tune the frequency of the four ports of a mesh router separately from the local port. As enablers for these techniques, we exploit Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and the imbalance in a generic router pipeline through time stealing. We also evaluate and analyze the proposed schemes from the point of view of reliability against soft error vulnerability and provide guidelines in choosing the appropriate scheme when reliability is the prime design constraint. Experiments using synthetic workloads on an 8 x 8 wormhole-switched mesh interconnect show that FreqBoost is a better choice for reducing average latency (maximum 40%) while, FreqThrtl provides the maximum benefits in terms of power saving and energy delay product (EDP). The FreqTune scheme is a better candidate for optimizing both performance and power, achieving on an average 36% reduction in latency, 13% savings in power (up to 24% at high load), and 40% savings (up to 70% at high load) in EDP. With application benchmarks, we observe IPC improvement up to 23% using our design. Our analysis shows FreqBoost to be the most robust scheme amongst the three schemes when reliability is a concern.

However, it is not yet clear what is the best form in which to present energy information. Two six-week experiments were carried out in student residences at the University of Bath, UK, to investigate how visually displayed energy information presented in different ways could encourage reductions in energy use. Experiment 1 compared three energy display interface designs (one giving numerical information, one using analogue dials and one using emotional faces) all presenting the same information. This resulted in a 7.7% savings over baseline. Experiment 2 examined how well participants responded to ranking information in numerical format about their own consumption. This resulted in a 2.5% reduction from baseline. Although there was a trend towards the ambient faces display performing best, all the displays led to a reduction in energy use. A significant decrease in consumption was also seen in the groups that saw ranking information, whether compared to their baseline consumption or to the control groups. In conclusion, it would appear that the mere presence of a display device can reduce energy use, even when participants are not engaged with the display. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

411,498,2012,WOS:000300463800022,,False,"Peak electricity demand has been an issue in the Desert Southwest region of the US, due to extreme summer temperatures. To address this issue, a consortium was formed between the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Pulte Homes, and NV Energy. An energy efficient residential community was developed by the team in Las Vegas with approximately 200 homes to study substation-level peak reduction strategies. A summer peak reduction of more than 65%, between 1:00 PM and 7:00 PM, compared to code standard housing developments is the targeted goal of the project. Approximately 50 homes are already built and some are occupied. The energy performances of the homes have been monitored and are presented in this paper. Several peak electric load reduction strategies such as energy efficiency in buildings, roof integrated photovoltaics (PV) and direct load control have been applied. Though all the homes in the developed community are installed with 1.8 kW(p) PV systems, the orientation of the PV system depends on the building orientation. Focus of this paper is to find the impact of PV orientation on the peak load from a building. In addition, different time-of-use (TOU) energy pricing options are offered by the local electrical utility company. Hence it is important to find an optimal pricing option for each building. A computer model has been developed for one of the homes in the new development using building energy simulation code, ENERGY-10. Calculations on the PV orientations have shown that a south and 220 degrees (i.e. 40 degrees west of due south) orientations are economically optimal for homes enrolled to flat electricity pricing schedule and time of use pricing respectively. As predicted by the simulations, the energy efficiency methods in the home have decreased the total annual energy by 38% compared to a code standard home of the same size. Further, the energy efficiency methods in the building coupled with a 220 degrees oriented PV and 1.1 degrees C increase in thermostat temperature for three hours (from 3:00 to 6:00 PM) reduced the peak energy demand by 62% compared to a code standard building of the same size. Battery storage is the other option that will be considered in the project at a later time which is expected to carry the project well beyond its peak reduction goals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

412,499,2012,WOS:000313661000019,,False,"We examine the problem of minimizing feedback in reliable wireless broadcasting by pairing rateless coding with extreme value theory. Our key observation is that, in a broadcast environment, this problem resolves into estimating the maximum number of packets dropped among many receivers rather than for each individual receiver. With rateless codes, this estimation relates to the number of redundant transmissions needed at the source in order for all receivers to correctly decode a message with high probability. We develop and analyze two new data dissemination protocols, called Random Sampling (RS) and Full Sampling with Limited Feedback (FSLF), based on the moment and maximum likelihood estimators in extreme value theory. Both protocols rely on a single-round learning phase, requiring the transmission of a few feedback packets from a small subset of receivers. With fixed overhead, we show that FSLF has the desirable property of becoming more accurate as the receivers' population gets larger. Our protocols are channel-agnostic, in that they do not require a priori knowledge of (i.i.d.) packet loss probabilities, which may vary among receivers. We provide simulations and an improved full-scale implementation of the Rateless Deluge over-the-air programming protocol on sensor motes as a demonstration of the practical benefits of our protocols, which translate into about 30% latency and energy consumption savings. Furthermore, we apply our protocols to real-time (RT) oblivious rateless codes in broadcast settings.

It is proposed that a dual-layer hollow fiber consisting of a fully finger-like macrovoid inner-layer and a sponge-like outer-layer may effectively enhance the permeation flux while maintaining the wetting resistance. Dual-layer fibers with the proposed morphology have been fabricated by the dry-jet wet spinning process via careful choice of dopes composition and coagulation conditions. In addition to high energy efficiency (EE) of 94%, a superior flux of 98.6 L m(-2) h(-1) is obtained during the direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) desalination experiments. Moreover, the liquid entry pressure (LEP) and long-term DCMD performance test show high wetting resistance and long-term stability. Mathematical modeling has been conducted to investigate the membrane mass transfer properties in terms of temperature profile and apparent diffusivity of the membranes. It is concluded that the enhancement in permeation flux arises from the coupling effect of two mechanisms; namely, a higher driving force and a lower mass transfer resistance, while the later is the major contribution. This work provides an insight on MD fundamentals and strategy to tailor making ideal membranes for DCMD application in desalination industry. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the efficiency of an isolation system can usually be quantified by the acceleration level transmitted onto the isolated object. In order to improve the performance of active isolation systems (AISs) for acceleration-sensitive equipment or structures, two optimal control laws that utilize performance indices associated with system absolute energy are proposed in this study. The first control law, which requires the measurement of the ground velocity in deciding the control force, is derived based on the concept of instantaneous optimal control. The second one is based on the concept of discrete-time optimal control, in which the feedback gain can be obtained by solving the discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation. The numerical simulation results of this study demonstrate that the isolation performance of an AIS system using the proposed absolute-energy-based control laws is much superior to the conventional optimal control in reducing the super-structural acceleration response for either near-fault or far-field earthquake. In addition, a comparison between the two proposed control laws reveals that the first control law has a lower acceleration response, whereas the second one results in less isolator displacement.

The welfare analysis is based on two alternative scenarios, a hypothetical percentage increase in the price of the commodity and a hypothetical percentage decrease in the amount of subsidy. The latter is considered to be a simultaneous problem in which the exact price of the commodity that reduces consumption, and subsequently the subsidy to the specific target level needs to be determined first. As a case study, the paper utilizes the most recent Household Expenditure Survey in the State of Kuwait to estimate residential electricity demand for different household groups (i.e., low-, middle-, and high-income), and employs a partial equilibrium model to measure the welfare implications that may result from a reduction in the electricity subsidy rates. The empirical findings show that a small increase in the price of electricity would reduce annual consumption by 4741 million kWh and annual subsidy by US$734 million. The results also show that the loss in consumers' welfare is approximately US$145 million, while the financial and environmental benefits to the society ranges between US$658 million and US$889 million. The magnitude of these welfare gains suggests that electricity price reforms combined with a rebate scheme to compensate households for their welfare loss, offsetting any political resistance to reform, is a win-win situation.

FSW is a novel joining technology enabling welds with excellent metallurgical and mechanical properties, as well as significant energy consumption and cost savings. However, numerous parameter and condition variations are present in the FSW production environment that can adversely affect weld quality, which has made extensive automation of this process impossible to date. To enable large scale automation while maintaining weld quality, techniques to control the FSW process in the presence of unknown disturbances must be developed. One process variable that must be controlled to maintain uniform weld quality under the inherent workpiece variability (thermal constraints, material properties, geometry, etc.) is the weld zone temperature. Our hypothesis is that the weld zone temperature can be controlled, which can help in controlling the weld quality. A wireless data acquisition system was built to measure temperatures at the tool-workpiece interface. A thermocouple was placed in a through hole right at the interface of tool and workpiece so that the tip is in contact with the workpiece material. This measurement strategy reveals temperature variations within a single rotation of the tool in real time. In order to automate the system, a first order process model with transport delay was experimentally developed that captures the physics between spindle speed and measured interface temperature. The model has a time constant of 110 ms and a delay time of 85 ms. Using this temperature measurement technique, a closed-loop temperature control system with a bandwidth of 0.3 Hz was developed. Interface temperatures in the range from 555 degrees C to 575 degrees C were commanded to an integral controller, which regulated the spindle speed between 850 rpm and 1250 rpm to adjust the heat generation and achieve the desired interface temperatures in 6061-T6 aluminum. To simulate changes in thermal boundary conditions, backing plates of different thermal diffusivities were found to effectively alter the heat flow, hence, weld zone temperature. The integral controller that manipulates spindle speed is applied when welding during these intentionally introduced weld disturbances. The measured temperature stayed within +/- 5 degrees C after introducing the disturbance, compared to a 50 degrees C change in temperature when no control was applied.

This combined use aims to increase the electric capacity factor of the SOFC-CGS by charging the PHEV using the SOFC-CGS electric power output late at night, and targets the application in regions where the reverse power flow from residential cogeneration systems to commercial electric power systems is not permitted, like in Japan. The optimal operation patterns of the combined use of 0.7-kWe SOFC-CGS and PHEV for a simulated energy demand with a sampling time of 1 h and various daily running distances of the PHEV show that this combined use increases the electric capacity factor of the SOFC-CGS and saves more energy in comparison with their separate use in which the SOFC-CGS is used but the PHEV is charged only with purchased electric power.

Both models can help to inform policy-makers and the public whether delivered energy in the domestic sector is on track and whether the reductions correspond with the expected impact of a more efficient domestic sector. The annual delivered energy, price, and temperature (ADEPT) model uses multiple linear regression to fit consumption data since 1970 (R(2) = 0.76). Findings indicate that with typical recent heating season temperatures of 7 degrees C and at 2005 energy prices, average household delivered energy is estimated at 21.7 MWh (95% confidence interval = 20.8, 22.6). For every 1 degrees C increase in heating season temperature, average household delivered energy drops by approximately 1 MWh/year. Energy price elasticity is estimated at -0.2, so that a 50% rise in energy prices corresponds to an approximate 10% decline in energy demand. To fit quarterly delivered energy data since 1998, a seasonal temperature energy price (STEP) model is also developed using polynomial multiple regression (R(2) > 0.99). At 2005 energy prices, the average household has a minimum power demand of 1.2 kW (including approximately 0.4 kW electricity) at about 16 degrees C, which rises as external temperatures drop to 5 degrees C, where it begins to plateau at approximately 3.8 kW. The average heat loss coefficient is estimated at 240-320 W/degrees C.

Nonetheless, little is known about how different data-driven link estimation methods affect routing behaviors. To address this issue, we classify existing data-driven link estimation methods into two broad categories: L-NT that uses aggregate information about unicast and L-ETX that uses information about the individual unicast-physical-transmissions. Through mathematical analysis and experimental measurement in a testbed of 98 XSM motes (an enhanced version of MICA2 motes), we examine the accuracy and stability of L-NT and L-ETX in estimating the ETX routing metric. We also experimentally study the routing performance of L-NT and L-ETX. We discover that these two representative, seemingly similar methods of data-driven link estimation differ significantly in routing behaviors: L-ETX is much more accurate and stable than L-NT in estimating the ETX metric, and accordingly, L-ETX achieves a higher data delivery reliability and energy efficiency than L-NT (for instance, by 25.18 percent and a factor of 3.75, respectively, in our testbed). These findings provide new insight into the subtle design issues in data-driven link estimation that significantly impact the reliability, stability, and efficiency of wireless routing, thus shedding light on how to design link estimation methods for mission-critical wireless networks which pose stringent requirements on reliability and predictability.",,,False,,,808902,,2018-06-13 09:49:14.500444+00:00,0,False,,,Comparison of Data-Driven Link Estimation Methods in Low-Power Wireless Networks,False,,,True,

This paper presents an optimal and automatic residential load commitment (LC) framework to achieve the household minimum payment. Problem decision variables are the operating status of responsive appliances and charging/discharging cycles of battery storage and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Storage capability in residential centers provide the customers with this opportunity to not only supply the local demand during the high price hours but also sell the energy back to the utility. The optimization-based LC shifts the responsive loads to inexpensive periods which rationally coincide with the valley of consumption profile. As a matter of fact, the peak to average ratio (PAR) of the load profile would likely decrease which, although might be unappealing to the customers, is desirable from the utility viewpoint. Direct load control (DLC) is also modeled by using the proposed LC approach. In the DLC program, a customer receives a rather fair tariff allowing the utility to control a set of specific devices. Customer inconvenience is considered as the factor restricting a complete DLC realization.

The rapid advances in computing and communication capabilities enable the concept smart buildings become possible. Most energy-consuming household tasks do not need to be performed at specific times but rather within a preferred time. If these types of tasks can be coordinated among multiple homes so that they do not all occur at the same time yet still satisfy customers' requirement, the energy cost and power peak demand could be reduced. In this paper, the optimal scheduling of smart homes' energy consumption is studied using a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach. In order to minimise a 1-day forecasted energy consumption cost, DER operation and electricity-consumption household tasks are scheduled based on real-time electricity pricing, electricity task time window and forecasted renewable energy output. Peak demand charge scheme is also adopted to reduce the peak demand from grid.

Based on one of the four smart grid pilots in China, our approach uses the survey data collected in 2011 from 236 residents in Yinchuan to implement a Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the minimum, expected and maximum demand responsiveness to four IOU rate designs. We find that residents do not respond to TOU pricing when the IOU rate design only causes a 10% increase in their existing electricity bills under non-TOU rates. However, their estimated peak demand responsiveness is 8.41% (21.26%) when the peak-time price increases by 20% (40%).

Although electronic monitoring thus can help in reducing the organization's environmental footprint, organizations may be reluctant to take such steps because of privacy concerns that may arise among those whose behavior is being monitored. This paper examines the roots of such privacy concerns. On the basis of literature on motivated cognition, we expect that people may sometimes construe privacy concerns in a self-serving fashion. Three empirical studies support this assumption and suggest an interesting and potentially controversial conclusion: electronic monitoring in itself may not necessarily raise concerns about privacy, except when people anticipate that monitoring will lead to negative consequences for them personally.

For these memory-constrained systems, the automatic dynamic memory manager (Garbage Collector or GC) has been always a key factor in terms of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) performance. Moreover, in current embedded platforms, power consumption is becoming as important as performance. Thus, in this paper we present an exploration, from an energy viewpoint, of the different possibilities of memory hierarchies for high-performance embedded systems when used by state-of-the-art GCs. This is a starting point for a better understanding of the interactions between the Java applications, the memory hierarchy and the GC. Hence, we subsequently present two techniques to reduce energy consumption on Java-based embedded systems, based on exploiting GC information. The first technique uses GC execution behavior to reduce leakage energy consumption taking advantage of the low-power mode of actual multi-banked SDRAM memories and it is intended for generational collectors. This technique can achieve a reduction up to 50% of SDRAM memory leakage. The second technique involves the inclusion of a software-controlled (scratch-pad) memory that stores GC instructions under the JVM control to reduce the active energy consumption and also improve the performance of the target embedded system and it is aimed at all kind of garbage collectors. For this last technique we have experimented with two different approaches for selecting the GC code to be stored in the scratchpad memory: one static and one dynamic. Our experimental results show that the proposed dynamic scratchpad management approach for GCs enables up to 63% energy consumption reduction and 25% performance improvement during the collector phase, which means, in terms of JVM execution, a global reduction of 29% and 17% for energy and cycles, respectively. Overall, this work outlines that the key for an efficient low-power implementation of Java Virtual Machines for high-performance embedded systems is the synergy between the GC choice, the memory architecture tuning, and the inclusion of power management schemes controlled by the JVM, exploiting knowledge of the GC behavior.

Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) is commonly employed as one of the most effective low energy techniques for real-time systems. It has been observed that the use of feedback-based methods can improve the effectiveness of DVS-enabled systems. In this paper, we have investigated reducing the energy consumption of fault-tolerant hard real-time systems using the feedback control theory. Our proposed method makes the system capable of selecting the proper frequency and voltage settings in order to reduce the energy consumption, while guaranteeing hard real-time requirements in the presence of unpredictable workload fluctuations and faults. In the proposed method, the available slack-time is exploited by a feedback-based DVS at runtime to reduce the energy consumption. Furthermore, some slack-time is reserved for re-execution in case of faults. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional DVS method, our proposed method not only provides up to 59% energy saving, but also satisfies hard real-time constraints.

In most cases, the AGN contribution can compensate the radiative loss of the X-ray gas within the cooling radius (similar or equal to 0.002 - 2.2 keV per particle), and apparently exceeds the energy required to cause the scaling relations to deviate from the self-similar predictions (similar or equal to 0.2 - 1.0 keV per particle). In contrast to the AGN feedback, the extra heating provided by supernova explosions accounts for similar or equal to 0.01 - 0.08 keV per particle in groups and is almost negligible in clusters. Therefore, the observed correlation between Delta K(0) and LK can be considered as direct evidence for AGN feedback in galaxy groups and clusters.",,,False,,,808950,,2018-07-06 16:51:30.737203+00:00,0,False,,,Central gas entropy excess as direct evidence for AGN feedback in galaxy groups and clusters,False,,,True,

We take inspiration from light-harvesting networks present in purple bacteria and simulate an incoherent dissipative energy transport process on more general and abstract networks, considering both regular structures (Cayley trees and hyperbranched fractals) and randomly generated ones. We focus on the the two primary light-harvesting complexes of purple bacteria, i.e., the LH1 and LH2, and we use network-theoretical centrality measures in order to select different LH1 arrangements. We show that different choices cause significant differences in the transport efficiencies, and that for regular networks, centrality measures allow us to identify arrangements that ensure transport efficiencies which are better than those obtained with a random disposition of the complexes. The optimal arrangements strongly depend on the dissipative nature of the dynamics and on the topological properties of the networks considered, and depending on the latter, they are achieved by using global versus local centrality measures. For randomly generated networks, a random arrangement of the complexes already provides efficient transport, and this suggests the process is strong with respect to limited amount of control in the structure design and to the disorder inherent in the construction of randomly assembled structures. Finally, we compare the networks considered with the real biological networks and find that the latter have in general better performances, due to their higher connectivity, but the former with optimal arrangements can mimic the real networks' behavior for a specific range of transport parameters.

456,554,2010,WOS:000208787200002,,False,"Real-time electricity pricing models can potentially lead to economic and environmental advantages compared to the current common flat rates. In particular, they can provide end users with the opportunity to reduce their electricity expenditures by responding to pricing that varies with different times of the day. However, recent studies have revealed that the lack of knowledge among users about how to respond to time-varying prices as well as the lack of effective building automation systems are two major barriers for fully utilizing the potential benefits of real-time pricing tariffs. We tackle these problems by proposing an optimal and automatic residential energy consumption scheduling framework which attempts to achieve a desired trade-off between minimizing the electricity payment and minimizing the waiting time for the operation of each appliance in household in presence of a real-time pricing tariff combined with inclining block rates. Our design requires minimum effort from the users and is based on simple linear programming computations. Moreover, we argue that any residential load control strategy in real-time electricity pricing environments requires price prediction capabilities. This is particularly true if the utility companies provide price information only one or two hours ahead of time. By applying a simple and efficient weighted average price prediction filter to the actual hourly-based price values used by the Illinois Power Company from January 2007 to December 2009, we obtain the optimal choices of the coefficients for each day of the week to be used by the price predictor filter. Simulation results show that the combination of the proposed energy consumption scheduling design and the price predictor filter leads to significant reduction not only in users' payments but also in the resulting peak-to-average ratio in load demand for various load scenarios.

Phys. Commun. 175 (2006) 624 Does the new version supersede the old program: No Nature of physical problem: Hadronic Production of B-c meson and its excited states Method of solution: To generate weighted and unweighted B-c events within PYTHIA environment effectively. Restrictions on the complexity of the problem: Hadronic production of (c (b) over bar)-quarkonium via the gluon-gluon fusion mechanism are given by the 'complete calculation approach'. The simulation of B-c events is done within PYTHIA environment. Reasons for new version: More and more data are accumulated at the large hadronic collider, it would be possible to make precise studies on B-c meson properties, such as its lifetime, mass spectrum and etc. The BCVEGPY has been adopted by several experimental groups due to its high efficiency in comparison to that of PYTHIA. However, to generate unweighted events with PYTHIA inner mechanism as programmed by the previous version is still time-consuming. So it would be helpful to improve the efficiency for generating unweighted events within PYTHIA. Moreover, it would be better to use an uniform and standard output format for further detector simulation. Typical running time: Typical running time is machine and user-parameters dependent. I) To generate 106 weighted S-wave (c (b) over bar)-quarkonium events (IDWTUP =3), it will take about 40 minutes on a 1.8 GHz Intel P4-processor machine. II) To generate unweighted S-wave (c (b) over bar)-quarkonium events with PYTHIA inner structure (IDWTUP = 1), it will take about 20 hour on a 1.8 GHz Intel P4-processor machine to generate 1000 events. III) To generate 106 unweightecl S-wave (c (b) over bar)-quarkonium events with the present trick (IDWTUP = 1), it will take 17 hour on a 3.16 Hz Intel E8500 processor machine. Moreover, it can be found that the running time for the P-wave (c (b) over bar)-quarkonium production is about two times longer than the case of S-wave production under the same conditions. Keywords: Event generator; Hadronic production; Be meson; Unweighted events Summary of revisions: (1) The generator BCVEGPY [1-3] has been programmed to generate Be events under PYTHIA environment [4], which has been frequently adopted for theoretical and experimental studies, e.g. Refs. [5-18]. It is found that each experimental group shall have its own simulation software architecture, and the users will spend a lot of time to write an interface so as to implement BCVEGPY into their own software. So it would be better to supply a standard output. The LHE format becomes a standard format [19], which is proposed to store process and event information from the matrix-element-based generators. The users can pass these parton-level information to the general event generators like PYTHIA and HERWIG [20] for further simulation. For such purpose, we add two common blocks in genevent.F. One common block is called as bcvegpy_pyupin and the other one is write_lhe. The bcvegpy_pyupin, which is similar to PYUPIN subroutine in PYTHIA, stores the initialization information in the HEPRUP common block. INTEGER MAXPUP PARAMETER (MAXPUP = 100) INTEGER IDBMUP,PDFGUP,PDFSUPIDWTUP,NPRUP,LPRUP DOUBLE PRECISION EBMUP,XSECUP,XERRUP,XMAXUP COMMON/HEPRUP/IDBMUP(2),EBMUP(2),PDFGUP(2),PDFSUP(2), &IDWTUP,NPRUP,XSECUP(MAXPUP),XERRUP(MAXPUP), &XMAXUP(MAXPUP),LPRUP(MAXPUP) The write_lhe, which is similar to PYUPEV subroutine in pythia, stores the information of each separate event in the HEPEUP common block. INTEGER MAXNUP PARAMETER (MAXNUP = 500) INTEGER NUP,IDPRUP,IDUP,ISTUP,MOTHUP,ICOLUP DOUBLE PRECISION XWGTUP,SCALUP,AQEDUP,AQCDUP,PUP,VTIMUP, &SPINUP COMMON/HEPEUP/NUP,IDPRUP,XWGTUP,SCALUP,AQEDUP,AQCDUP, &IDUP(MAXNUP),ISTUP(MAXNUP),MOTHUP(2,MAXNUP), &ICOLUP(2,MAXNUP),PUP(5,MAXNUP),VTIMUP(MAXNUP), &SPINUP(MAXNUP) The above information can be separately exported to two files 'bcvegpy.init and bcvegpy.evnt'. Then with the help of the PYTHIA subroutine PYLHEF, we can combine these two files into a single LHE file 'bcvegpy.lhe'. (2) As for previous version of BCVEGPY [1-3], its main concern is to improve theoretical estimations, i.e. to obtain a precise result as fast as possible. For the purpose, the VEGAS [21] running together with IDWTUP = 3 is usually appreciated. Firstly, by running VEGAS, one can obtain a sampling importance function, and then the phase-space points are generated according to the relative importance of their corresponding differential cross-sections. This sampling importance function is useful, since the integrand for the phase space integration can be regularized for obtaining a high precision total/differential cross section [21]. Secondly, by setting IDWTUP= 3, all parton-level events when input to PYTHIA shall always be accepted, i.e. almost all the calculated points are effective ones and shall be evolved as final events. As a combination of these two choices, one can generate events within the so-called importance sampling approach, i.e. the parton-level events have been effectively input into PYTHIA with proper weighted phase space. This is one of the reasons why BCVEGPY runs so fast(1) Experimentally, it is the unweighted inputs other than the weighted inputs that are usually needed. By default BCVEGPY generates unweighted events following the same scheme of PYTHIA. For the purpose, one has to set PYTHIA parameter IDWTUP = 1, then all events in a run are treated on an equal footing. And the parton-level events are uniformly generated within the whole phase space, but with a weight (XWGTUP) when input to PYTHIA, and then these events are accepted or rejected with probability XWGTUP/XMAXUP (XMAXUP is the maximum weight of the process). As most of the calculated parton-level events are rejected by this criteria, such a naive scheme is usually time-consuming. For example, by setting IDWTUP =1, it takes about 20 hours on a 1.8 GHz Intel P4-processor machine to generate 1000 Be events. It is too slow if one wants to simulate a large amount of events. Here, we present a new scheme to improve the efficiency of generating unweighted events within PYTHIA environment. For the purpose, we first unweight the events by using the standard hit-and-miss technique [22]. Then, we set IDWTUP= 1, but we replace XMAXUP to be a reference weight that can be generated by earlier exploratory run.(2) Each parton-level event shall result in a ratio between the weight XWGTUP to the reference weight. When such ratio is smaller than one, the event shall be retained or rejected based on whether the ratio is greater or less than the return value of random number generating function PYR(0). When the ratio is larger than one, its integral part stands for the basic number the same events to be generated. And the basic number shall be increased by one or unchanged based on whether its decimal part is greater or less than a random number PYR(0). It is found that a larger reference weight means more events to be rejected and less efficiency. So, to set a proper reference weight is [GRAPHICS] a tricky problem, which requires exploratory running under one's own experimental cuts and should have negligible derivation from theoretical estimations. For example, one may observe that for ATLAS transverse momentum cut P-Tcut = 4 GeV and the rapidity cut y(cut) = 2.5, only few events' weight are larger than the value of 10(6) pb. So we can set this valve as the reference weight, which is reasonable for the LHC B-c production simulation. The code for the newly suggested unweighted scheme is put in the main program 'bcvegpy.F'. As a cross check, we present the weighted and unweighted Be transverse momentum PT-distribution and pseudorapidity eta-distribution in Fig. 1, which are represented by solid line and dotted lines respectively. The unweighted distributions are obtained by setting IDWTUP = 1 and using the new strategy described above, while the weighted distributions are obtained by setting IDWTUP = 3. It can be found that the weighted and unweighted distributions coincide with each other. Since the new unweighted scheme is time-saving in comparison with that of the previous one, so it can be adopted for generating large amount of events, which may suit the needs of the newly accumulating data at LHC. Moreover, to compare and validate the result of BCVEGPY, we also use PYTHIA's inner mechanism to generate B-c meson at the very beginning. For such purpose, we set MSEL = 5 to generate b (c) over bar first, and then add one filter (PDGID = 541) that searches and stores every event that shall result in at least one Be meson. Next, we use the external decay generator EVTGEN [23], which can be running under the PYTHIA environment, to simulate the Bc decay channel Bc -> J/psi + pi. The remaining parameters for PYTHIA are taken to be their default values. Moreover, in doing the calculation, we set the collision energy of LHC to be the present value of 7 TeV. The comparison is presented in Fig. 2, which shows that the normalized distributions for PYTHIA and BCVEGPY agree with each other well. Such an observation also agrees with the previous conclusion drawn by Ref. [12].",,,False,,,808968,,2018-07-06 16:51:48.007785+00:00,0,False,,,A trick to improve the efficiency of generating unweighted B-c events from BCVEGPY,False,,,True,

465,564,1998,WOS:000073011800016,,False,"The dynamic computer model of oxidative phosphorylation developed previously and successfully tested for large-scale changes in fluxes and metabolite concentrations was used to study the question of how the rate of ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation is adjusted to meet the energy demand during muscle contraction, which causes a great increase in ATP consumption in relation to the resting state. The changes in the respiration rate and ATP/ADP ratio after the onset of maximal work measured experimentally were compared with simulated changes in the respiration rate and ATP/ADP in several different cases, assuming direct activation of different steps by an external effector. On the basis of the computer simulations performed, it was possible to conclude which enzymes/metabolic blocks should be directly activated to cause the experimentally observable changes in fluxes and metabolite concentrations. The theoretical results obtained suggest that the parallel direct activation of actinomyosin-ATP-ase and oxidative phosphorylation by an external effector (for example calcium ions) is the main mechanism responsible for fitting of ATP production to ATP consumption, while the negative feedback via an increase in ADP concentration (decrease in ATP/ADP), which indirectly activates the ATP supply, plays only a minor role. Additionally, the conclusion is drawn that most of the oxidative phosphorylation steps should be directly activated in order to explain the observed changes in the respiration rate and ATP/ADP ratio (and also in other parameters) during muscle contraction. It is suggested that there should exist a universal external activator/regulatory mechanism which causes a parallel stimulation of different enzymes/processes.

S. natural gas price volatility since the mid-to-late-1980s deregulation generally is attributed to the deregulated market being more sensitive to temperature-related residential demand. This study therefore quantifies relations between winter (November-February; December-February) temperature and residential gas consumption for the United States east of the Rocky Mountains for 1989-2000, by region and on monthly and seasonal time scales. State-level monthly gas consumption data are aggregated for nine multistate subregions of three Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts of the U. S. Department of Energy. Two temperature indices [days below percentile (DBP) and heating degree-days (HDD)] are developed using the Richman-Lamb fine-resolution (similar to 1 degrees latitude-longitude) set of daily maximum and minimum temperatures for 1949-2000. Temperature parameters/values that maximize DBP/HDD correlations with gas consumption are identified. Maximum DBP and HDD correlations with gas consumption consistently are largest in the Great Lakes-Ohio Valley region on both monthly (from +0.89 to +0.91) and seasonal (from +0.93 to +0.97) time scales, for which they are based on daily maximum temperature. Such correlations are markedly lower on both time scales (from +0.62 to +0.80) in New England, where gas is less important than heating oil, and on the monthly scale ( rom +0.55 to +0.75) across the South because of low January correlations. For the South, maximum correlations are for daily DBP and HDD indices based on mean or minimum temperature. The percentiles having the highest DBP index correlations with gas consumption are slightly higher for northern regions than across the South. This is because lower (higher) relative (absolute) temperature thresholds are reached in warmer regions before home heating occurs. However, these optimum percentiles for all regions are bordered broadly by surrounding percentiles for which the correlations are almost as high as the maximum. This consistency establishes the robustness of the temperature-gas consumption relations obtained. The reference temperatures giving the highest HDD correlations with gas consumption are lower for the colder northern regions than farther south where the temperature range is truncated. However, all HDD reference temperatures greater than +10 degrees C (+15 degrees C) yield similar such correlations for northern (southern) regions, further confirming the robustness of the findings. This robustness, coupled with the very high correlation magnitudes obtained, suggests that potentially strong gas consumption predictability would follow from accurate seasonal temperature forecasts.",,,False,,,808991,,2018-06-18 16:00:02.823923+00:00,0,False,,,Relations between temperature and residential natural gas consumption in the central and eastern United States,False,,,True,

In contrast to random or contention-based medium access control schemes, a protocol sequence-based scheme can serve to provide at least a certain number of contention-free packet transmissions within a bounded delay for each asynchronous user in a feedback-free multiple access system. However, all protocol sequence-based schemes in the literature require that all sequence entries are mapped to slots with the same time duration, which produces a relatively low channel utilization. To overcome this inefficiency that is undesirable in delay-constrained wireless sensor networks, building on the idea of combining sequence-based access and carrier sensing, this paper proposes a new protocol sequence-based scheme, called the PS-CS. We derive the theoretical average throughput, average access delay, worst-case delay, and average energy consumption of the PS-CS. It is shown that the PS-CS produces average throughput close to the optimal capacity of p-persistent carrier sense multiple access (CSMA), and enjoys smaller access delay than the optimal p-persistent CSMA.

Recently, dynamic frequency scaling (DFS) and dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) have been added to a various embedded processors as a means to increase battery life. A number of scheduling techniques have been developed to exploit DFS and DVS for real-time systems to reduce energy consumption. These techniques exploit idle and slack time of a schedule. Idle time can be consumed by lowering the processor frequency of selected tasks while slack time allows later tasks to execute at lower frequencies with reduced voltage demands. Our work delivers energy savings beyond the level of prior work. We enhance the earliest-deadline first (EDF) scheduling to exploit slack time generated by the invocation of the task at multiple frequency levels within the same invocation. The technique relies strictly on operating system support within the scheduler to implement the approach. Early scaling at a low frequency, determined by a feedback mechanism and facilitated by a slack-passing scheme, capitalizes on high probabilities of a task to finish its execution without utilizing its worst-case execution budget. If a task does not complete at a certain point in time within its low frequency range, the remainder of it continues to execute at a higher frequency.

However, the potential value of distributed generation and demand flexibility has not yet been fully realized in the operation of MGs. This study investigates the pricing and operation strategy with DR for a MG retailer in an integrated energy system (IES).

Main issues like integrated energy coupling and customer bill reduction are addressed during pricing to ensure rates competitiveness and customer protection. By evaluating on real datasets, the system is demonstrated to optimally coordinate storage, renewables, and combined heat and power (CHP), reduce carbon dioxide emission while maintaining profits, and effectively alleviate the PV curtailment problem.

Tailoring the microstructure and properties of these thermal barrier coatings towards achieving both prime reliance and manufacturing reproducibility is a complex task due to the multitude of interrelated parameters that influence the plasma spray process and the deposit formation dynamics. In this article, we report on a study that connects thermal spray coatings through process science and materials science utilizing the concept of process maps. Process maps are representations of interrelationships among control parameters and measured responses. First-order process maps have been established for three YSZ powder morphologies, linking the plasma forming torch parameters to the particle state (responses) through a design of experiments approach and in-flight diagnostics. Refinements to representation of the raw particle characteristics are proposed through the use of group parameters (melting index and kinetic energy) from the experimental results. First-order process maps have been used for process parameterization and feedback control. Correlating the first-order responses with coating properties allows representation of coating properties in the form of second-order process maps and enables identification of process windows.

For example, when an insect is exposed to an additional load parallel to the direction in which it is walking, the walking pattern changes according to the magnitude of the load. Furthermore, even after some of its legs have been amputated, an insect will produce walking patterns with its remaining legs. These adaptations in insect walking could not previously be explained by a mathematical model, since the mathematical models were based upon the hypothesis that the relationship between walking velocity and walking patterns is fixed under all conditions. We have produced a mathematical model which describes self-organizing insect walking patterns in real-time by using feedback information regarding muscle load (Kimura et al. 1993). As part of this model, we introduced a new rule to coordinate leg movement, in which the information is circulated to optimize the efficiency of the energy transduction of each effector organ. We describe this mechanism as the least dissatisfaction for the greatest number of elements'. In this paper, we introduce the following aspects of this model, which reflect adaptability to changing circumstances: (1) after one leg is exposed to a transient perturbation, the walking pattern recovers swiftly; (2) when the external load parallel to the walking direction is continuously increased or decreased, the pattern transition point is shifted according to the magnitude of the load increment or decrement. This model generates a walking pattern which optimizes energy consumption at a given walking velocity even under these conditions; and (3) when some of the legs are amputated, the model generates walking patterns which are consistent with experimental results.

By developing a cost-effective L2 cache architecture using multibit ECC, this paper attempts to show that, with appropriate cache architecture design, this common belief may not necessarily hold true for L2 cache. The basic idea is to supplement a conventional L2 cache core with several special-purpose small caches/buffers, which can greatly reduce the silicon cost and minimize the probability of explicitly executing multibit ECC decoding on the cache read critical path, and meanwhile, maintain soft error tolerance. Experiments show that, at the random defect density of 0.5 percent, this design approach can maintain almost the same instruction per cycle (IPC) performance over a wide spectrum of benchmarks compared with ideal defect-free L2 cache, while only incurring less than 3 percent of silicon area overhead and 36 percent power consumption overhead.",,,False,,,809008,,2018-06-22 09:38:21.641803+00:00,0,False,,,Leveraging Access Locality for the Efficient Use of Multibit Error-Correcting Codes in L2 Cache,False,,,True,

Methods: A prospective longitudinal study was conducted on Saudi normal pregnant women during the course of pregnancy (N=80), at term and 6-10 weeks postpartum (N=65), during the period January 1997 through to December 2000. Maternal urinary iodine excretion was determined together with serum levels of total thyroxine, total tri-iodothyronine, free thyroxine, free tri-iodothyronine, thyrotropin, reverse tri-iodothyronine, thyroxine-binding globulin and thyroglobulin. A group of non-pregnant woman (N=200) were included for comparative purposes. Data were also analyzed for significant trends using ANOVA. Neonatal serum levels of total thyroxine, total tri-iodothyronine, free thyroxine, thyrotropin, thyroxine-binding globulin, and thyroglobulin were also measured. Results: Changes in urinary iodine excretion and in serum thyroid function parameters during the course of pregnancy, at term and postpartum have been demonstrated. Subclinical iodine deficiency was evident in 28.8% of pregnant women at term and 11.5% of women at 6-10 weeks postpartum. Serum total thyroxine and total tri-iodothyronine levels increased in the first trimester (P<0.001) and remained elevated at term (P<0.001). Serum free thyroxine levels showed a significant decrease by the 2nd trimester (P<0.001) and continued to decrease in the 3rd trimester (P<0.001). Serum free triiodothyronine showed continuous decrease throughout gestation. Thyrotropin levels were decreased during the first and 2nd trimesters (P<0.001) but then increased to be comparable to non-pregnant values. Serum reverse triiodothyronine increased during the first and 2nd trimesters (P<0.001). There was a significant increase in serum thyroxine-binding globulin and thyroglobulin levels during the course of pregnancy. A significant negative correlation between thyrotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin levels was observed throughout pregnancy (r=-0.31, P<0.001). The observed correlation was stronger (r=-0.37 P<0.001) in the first trimester as compared to that in the second (r=-0.164; P<0.001) or the third (r=-0.125; P<0.269) trimester. There was a negative correlation between maternal free thyroxine and neonatal thyrotropin (r=-0.70; P<0.001). Positive correlation was found between neonatal total thyroxine and birth weight (r=0.61; P<0.001) and maternal urinary iodine concentration (P<0.001). Conclusion: The changes in urinary iodine excretion during the course of pregnancy were documented. The decrease in free thyroxine and free tri-iodothyronine and the increase in reverse tri-iodothyronine concentrations during pregnancy resemble the changes in thyroid hormones seen in non-thyroidal illness. Moreover, the changes in thyrotropin in relation to that of human chorionic gonadotropin support the view that the thyroid gland is not primarily thyrotropin driven in early pregnancy. The results suggest that a more complex control may finally regulate maternal thyroid activity; the pituitary and the chorionic systems both function in an independent way in response to possible different feedback stimuli.

Here, we consider the Earth's exterior cusp and plasma mantle, where the ionospheric origin escaping ions with finite temperatures are loaded into the decelerated solar wind flow. Due to direct connectivity to the ionosphere through the geomagnetic field, a large part of this electrical energy is consumed to maintain field-aligned currents (FACs) toward the ionosphere, in a similar manner as the solar wind-driven ionospheric convection in the open geomagnetic field region. We show that the energy extraction rate by the mass loading of escaping ions (Delta K) is sufficient to explain the cusp FACs, and that Delta K depends only on the solar wind velocity accessing the mass-loading region (u(sw)) and the total mass flux of the escaping ions into this region (m(load)F(load)), as Delta K similar to -m(load)F(load)u(sw)(2)/4. The expected distribution of the separated charges by this process also predicts the observed flowing directions of the cusp FACs for different interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) orientations if we include the deflection of the solar wind flow directions in the exterior cusp. Using empirical relations of u(0) alpha Kp+1.2 and F-load alpha exp(0.45Kp) for Kp = 1- 7, where u(0) is the solar wind velocity upstream of the bow shock, Delta K becomes a simple function of Kp as log10 (Delta K) = 0.2.Kp+2.log(10).

The major contribution of this nearly linear increase is the F-load term, i.e. positive feedback between the increase of ion escaping rate F-load through the increased energy consumption in the ionosphere for high Kp, and subsequent extraction of more kinetic energy Delta K from the solar wind to the current system by the increased F-load. Since F-load significantly increases for increased flux of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation, high EUV flux may significantly enhance this positive feedback. Therefore, the ion escape rate and the energy extraction by mass loading during ancient Earth, when the Sun is believed to have emitted much higher EUV flux than at present, could have been even higher than the currently available highest values based on Kp = 9.

Cooling of commercial buildings contributes significantly to the peak demand placed on an electrical utility grid and time-of-use electricity rates are designed to encourage shifting of electrical loads to off-peak periods at night and on weekends. Buildings can respond to these pricing signals by shifting cooling-related thermal loads either by precooling the building's massive structure (passive storage) or by using active thermal energy storage systems such as ice storage. Recent theoretical and experimental work showed that the simultaneous utilization of active and passive building thermal storage inventory can save significant amounts of utility costs to the building operator yet increased electrical energy consumption may result. The article investigates the relationship between cost savings and energy consumption associated with conventional control, minimal cost and minimal energy control, while accounting for variations in fan power consumption, chiller capacity, chiller coefficient-of-performance, and part-load performance. The model-based predictive building controller is employed to either minimize electricity cost including a target demand charge or electrical energy consumption.

Both supernova (SN) explosions and magnetorotational instability (MRI) have been proposed to drive turbulence in gas disks and we compare the H I line widths predicted from turbulence driven by these mechanisms to direct observations in 11 disk galaxies. We use high-quality maps of the H I mass surface density and line width, obtained by The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey. We show that all sample galaxies exhibit a systematic radial decline in the H I line width, which appears to be a generic property of H I disks and also implies a radial decline in kinetic energy density of H I. At a galactocentric radius of r(25)-often comparable to the extent of significant star formation-there is a characteristic value of the H I velocity dispersion of 10 +/- 2 km s(-1). Inside this radius, galaxies show H I line widths well above the thermal value (corresponding to similar to 8 km s(-1)) expected from a warm H I component, implying that turbulence drivers must be responsible for maintaining this line width. Therefore, we compare maps of H I kinetic energy to maps of the star formation rate (SFR)-a proxy for the SN rate-and to predictions for energy generated by MRI. We find a positive correlation between kinetic energy of H I and SFR; this correlation also holds at fixed Sigma(H I), as expected if SNe were driving turbulence. For a given turbulence dissipation timescale, we can estimate the energy input required to maintain the observed kinetic energy. The SN rate implied by the observed recent SFR is sufficient to maintain the observed velocity dispersion, if the SN feedback efficiency is at least epsilon(SN) similar or equal to 0.1 x (10(7) yr/tau(D)), assuming tau(D) similar or equal to 10(7) yr for the turbulence dissipation timescale. Beyond r(25), this efficiency would have to increase to unrealistic values, epsilon greater than or similar to 1, suggesting that mechanical energy input from young stellar populations does not supply most kinetic energy in outer disks.

Analysis is based on simulating distributed heterogeneous oxygen transport in the myocardium integrated with a detailed model of cardiac energy metabolism. The model predicts that baseline myocardial free inorganic phosphate (P-i) concentration in the canine myocyte cytoplasm - a variable not accessible to direct non-invasive measurement - is approximately 0.29 mM and increases to 2.3 mM near maximal cardiac oxygen consumption. During acute ischaemia (from ligation of the left anterior descending artery) P-i increases to approximately 3.1 mM and ATP consumption in the ischaemic tissue is reduced quickly to less than half its baseline value before the creatine phosphate (CrP) pool is 18% depleted. It is determined from these experiments that the maximal rate of oxygen consumption of the heart is an emergent property and is limited not simply by the maximal rate of ATP synthesis, but by the maximal rate at which ATP can be synthesized at a potential at which it can be utilized. The critical free energy of ATP hydrolysis for cardiac contraction that is consistent with these findings is approximately -63.5 kJ mol(-1).

Lasers stripped of 0, 3, and 5 mm of cladding, initiated shutdown at 2.9 +/- 0.13, 5.1 +/- 0.09, and 8.2 +/- 0.15 mm from the ureteroscope distal end, respectively (P <0.01). A single DUR-D ureteroscope was used for all trials and remained completely intact through 120 retractions of the active Laser fiber into the channel. CONCLUSIONS In this evaluation, the novel EPS was highly effective and reliable. When using indigo carmine or high-density blood concentrations, the efficacy of the EPS was compromised. The EPS should be used to complement standard safe laser technique rather than to replace it.",,,False,,,809077,,2018-07-09 12:20:09.704391+00:00,0,False,,,Evaluation of efficacy of novel optically activated digital endoscope protection system against laser energy damage,False,,,True,
508,614,1992,WOS:A1992JL98500001,,False,"In the introduction to the present paper the authors describe the development of the Berlin School of Dynamic Psychiatry, also defined as Human Structurology, in the last 25 years following Ammon's classical psychiatric and psychoanalytic training in Germany and the USA. This development was prompted by the insufficiency of traditional therapeutic thinking and practice, when confronted with severe borderline, psychotic, psychosomatic and obsessive-compulsive illness. The treatment of such patients calls for a deep change of approach, whose various facets can be summed up as a change of paradigm. It involves a new approach to science, to man and to illness, implicitly also to oneself and to society; further, a new conception of health and disease, of body, mind and spirit. Science is subordinated, in this conception, to the human being in all his dimensions, rendering dynamic psychiatry a true science of man. In its understanding of severe psychiatric disorders, as for example the psychoses, dynamic psychiatry follows a path opposed to the dogmatic belief defining them as unintelligible and untreatable. In this context, the therapeutic significance of the new paradigm is a consequence of Ammon's therapeutic optimism. >>Only he can heal, who believes in healing..<< The fundamental principle of human structural science is its own image of man. Man is, in this concept, a multidimensional being with healthy as well as pathological aspects, whereas the healthy elements are relevant for therapeutic work. Man is a being living in groups, whose dynamics condition the development of his personality. At the same time, he is, in Ammon's words, >>an individual being striving for identity, self realization and a sense of his existence.<< Accordingly, illness is defined as a loss of the homeostasis of body, mind and spirit, a restriction of multidimensionality and a development arrest. In the concept of dynamic psychiatry, identity is a group-related process dependent on social energy and involving continuous development during the whole life. Social energy replaces the Freudian libido concept. It is the energy inherent in human contacts and relationships. Social energetic exchange plays the main role in building up and structuring personality. Thus, personality structure can be visualized as manifested social energy. The human structural model described by the authors is based on their conception of identity and the image of man. Human structure contains the areas of primary (meaning organic), central (meaning mainly unconscious) and secondary human functions (meaning functions of behaviour). These three areas are synergistically and dynamically interconnected and related to surrounding groups, whose internalized dynamics in early childhood make up the major part of the unconscious. The spectrum of interaction of single human functions ranges from regulated and integrated to poorly regulated and desintegrated functions. According to Ammon's spectral theory, not only the three human structural areas, but also their constructive, destructive and deficient aspects are understood as lying on a continuum. A large part of the paper is consecrated to the conceptualization of illness within the framework of Human Structurology. Illness is structurally understood as a temporary loss of homeostasis and desintegration of personality functions, but at the same time it makes demands on the whole personality which cannot cope with its deficiently developed parts (>>holes in the Ego<<, in Ammon's words). Consequently, symptoms have the meaning of filling such deficits, in order to avoid a breakdown of the whole personality. Thus, the aim of treatment consists not in symptom alleviation, but rather in enabling the patient to develop his human structure by transforming destructive and deficient into constructive aspects. This therapeutic process must take place primarily in the nonconscious core of the personality. Clinical experience shows that symptom reduction occurs as a consequence of structural development. The ultimate goal of treatment is directed toward identity development, improving the contact ability of the patient. >>Identity therapy must reach man's inner core.<< This is achieved by constructive social energetic exchange processes within the groups, and this fact entails a definite therapeutic conception. Dynamic psychiatric therapy offers the patient, with his desintegrated personality, the possibility of taking up contact to his own non-conscious needs, to other people and to his surroundings. In the dynamic psychiatric hospital Menterschwaige, this therapeutic conception is realized by the multidimensional verbal and non-verbal methods integrated into a milieu therapeutic and social energetic field involving the whole hospital. The therapeutic program is individually planned for each patient and involves individual and group therapy, milieu therapeutic work on various projects, as well as dance therapy, music therapy, theatre and art therapy, riding and sport therapy. The single therapy forms are integrated on the level of control groups of the therapeutic team and of the plenary group of the whole hospital. In a short historical review, the authors show that psychotherapeutic treatment of severe ego disturbances, like the psychoses, cannot be achieved by individual therapy alone. Rather, it makes basic therapy in groups necessary, using the tod of group dynamics. In the therapeutic of the hospital, each patient has several therapists and is part of several groups. . The authors describe in detail the analytical group therapy and the milieu groups in their theoretical and practical aspects as a temporary therapeutic life community. The specific caracteristics of the non-verbal therapy forms are also described by the authors, for instance the enacting of the patient's own pathology in the theatre therapy, the importance of body language in dance therapy and the group dynamic polyphonic work in music therapy. However, non-verbal therapy is always connected with, and must lead towards, verbal expression of the patient; the integrating function of verbalisation is thereby emphasized. Fundamental for the whole therapy is the work with the healthy parts of the personality, while working through deficient and destructive human functions. Dynamic psychiatric treatment is centered around working through of the destructive aggression. Further therapeutic instruments are the systematic use of the mirror function within the groups and the social work with the family of the patient during the whole time of therapy. Exemplarily, the problem of paranoic patients is discussed, stressing the importance of the resistance triangle of aggression, paranoia and pathological narcissism, as described by Ammon in earlier works. Above all, therapy is understood as a process involving the whole person, based on the implicit image of man in his inherent capacity of further development. In this context, the authors emphasize that the therapist must be experienced by the patient in his true human wholeness as a partner in his relationship to the patient. The following chapter of the paper deals with the human structural diagnosing process, also based on holistic understanding. It involves not only psychiatric, but also psychogenetic, group dynamic and human strucutral assessment of the personality, completed by a number of standardized psychological tests, among which Ammon's Ego Structure Test (ISTA) is described in detail. Further diagnostic means include the Autokinetic Light Test (AKL), as well as sociometric and group-diagnostical investigations and electroencephalographic sleep registrations. The complexity of diagnostic results is integrated in the case conferences which allow a global understanding of the specific personality structure of the patient, his development and the planning of adequate therapy. Diagnostic work runs parallel to the therapeutic process and implies a continuous feedback of information, serving as an indicator of the treatment efficiency. The authors present the human structural model of personality assessment, as a hypothetical construction allowing an insight in the non conscious human structure by means of behavioural and experiencial secondary functions. This theoretical model constitutes the basis of efficiency investigations in the dynamic psychiatric hospital. The authors describe a shortcut of the results obtained in the course of efficiency investigations. These show a significant increase of healthy personality functions, expressed on the behavioral level, an increase in the capacity of tying relationships, in working and learning ability,and an improved contact to oneself and the environment. At the same time a decrease of deficient and destructive personality functions becomes evident. The paramount therapeutic importance of the work on destructive aggression is again emphasized. An extension of the efficiency research is provided by the catamnestic investigations of the Munich Catamnestic Project, whose first results are presented by the authors.

However, direct gas measurements are limited by sensitivity and other uncertainties. Dust provides an efficient indirect probe of the total gas. We apply this technique to a large sample of quasars, whose total gas content would be prohibitively expensive to measure. We present a comprehensive study of the full (1 to 500 mu m) infrared spectral energy distributions of 87 redshift < 0.5 quasars selected from the Palomar-Green sample, using photometric measurements from 2MASS, WISE, and Herschel, combined with Spitzer mid-infrared (5-40 mu m) spectra. With a newly developed Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting method, we decompose various overlapping contributions to the integrated spectral energy distribution, including starlight, warm dust from the torus, and cooler dust on galaxy scales. This procedure yields a robust dust mass, which we use to infer the gas mass, using a gas-to-dust ratio constrained by the host galaxy stellar mass. Most (90%) quasar hosts have gas fractions similar to those of massive, star-forming galaxies, although a minority (10%) seem genuinely gas-deficient, resembling present-day massive early-type galaxies. This result indicates that ""quasar mode"" feedback does not occur or is ineffective in the host galaxies of low-redshift quasars. We also find that quasars can boost the interstellar radiation field and heat dust on galactic scales. This cautions against the common practice of using the far-infrared luminosity to estimate the host galaxy star formation rate.",,,False,,,809079,,2018-06-13 11:06:50.679703+00:00,0,False,,,On the Gas Content and Efficiency of AGN Feedback in Low-redshift Quasars,False,,,True,

Arbitrary input distributions and flat fading are considered. A generic multiuser detector in the form of the posterior mean estimator is applied before single-user decoding. The generic detector can be particularized to the matched filter, decorrelator, linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detector, the jointly or the individually optimal detector, and others. It is found that the detection output for each user, although in general asymptotically non-Gaussian conditioned on the transmitted symbol, converges as the number of users go to infinity to a deterministic function of a ""hidden"" Gaussian statistic independent of the interferers. Thus, the multiuser channel can be decoupled: Each user experiences an equivalent single-user Gaussian channel, whose signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) suffers a degradation due to the multiple-access interference (MAI). The uncoded error performance (e.g., symbol error rate) and the mutual information can then be fully characterized using the degradation factor, also known as the multiuser efficiency, which can be obtained by solving a pair of coupled fixed-point equations identified in this paper.

One of the new developments on the demand side is purchases made by a coalition of consumers. It seems indeed likely that in the future this will be more common, and that coalitions of consumers will emerge when they are worthwhile. The aim of this paper is to study how such an organization of consumers can be set up in a hierarchical framework. This new approach has not been described before in the deregulated electricity markets but is clearly an important research topic. We focus our interest on electric space heating, which is an energy need especially important in the Nordic countries such as Finland. We examine the consumption strategies of individual electricity buyers within a coalition. The decision problem all consumers face is to find the optimal use of their space heating system with respect to changes in electricity prices and to their tolerance to indoor temperature variation. A mathematical model for this problem is defined. Physical parameters of sample houses were gathered from an experimental field test conducted in Helsinki during the winter of 1996. The coalition buys in the market at marginal cost. However, as marginal cost pricing may not always fulfill metering and communication needs of the members of the coalition, we consider Time-Of-Use (TOU) pricing within the coalition. Different groups of consumer behavior are constructed to simulate this coalition. The optimal marginal price is used as a reference point to estimate the nearest TOU price within the coalition.

Previous research works show that modulation scaling is an efficient technique to reduce energy consumption. However, the impacts of using modulation scaling on packet delivery latency and loss are not considered, which may have adverse effects on the application qualities. In this paper, we study this problem and propose control schemes to minimize energy consumption while ensuring application qualities. We first analyze the relationships of modulation scaling and energy consumption, end-to-end delivery latency and packet loss ratio. With the analytical model, we develop a centralized control scheme to adaptively adjust the modulation levels, in order to minimize energy consumption and ensure the application qualities. To improve the scalability of the centralized control scheme, we also propose a distributed control scheme. In this scheme, the sink will send the differences between the required and measured application qualities to the sensors. The sensors will update their modulation levels with the local information and feedback from the sink. Experimental results show the effectiveness of energy saving and QoS guarantee of the control schemes.

The rapid progress in this field is attributed to the development of absorbing layers, interfacial materials or interfacial modification, device architectures and so on. Especially, the interfaces in the devices significantly affect the exciton dissociation, charge carrier transport and collection, and subsequently affect the device performance. This review focuses on the interface engineering in organic solar cells, polymer/nanocrystal hybrid solar cells and perovskite solar cells in our group. We summarize the strategies of designing effective interfacial materials including hole-transporting materials, electron-transporting materials and their modification to achieve ohmic contact at the interface of active layer and electrodes. A series of low-temperature solution processed low-cost inorganic materials and organic small molecules are developed. With appropriate energy levels, high mobility and low defect or ability to passivate perovskites, highly efficient organic and perovskite solar cells are achieved. Self-assembly monolayer technologies are also discussed here. It is an efficient way to modify the work function of electrodes to obtain ohmic contact between electrodes and active layer. On one hand, the self-assembly monolayer can also be used to passivate the defect of metal oxide buffer layer such as ZnO or TiO2 to reduce recombination, which may improve the morphology of perovskite film to enhance the performance. Plasmonic effect is introduced to enhance the light absorption of active layer by incorporating Au or Ag nanoparticles into the interface layers.

By attaching benzenedithiol ligands onto the surface of CdSe nanocrystals in the ""face-on"" geometry, the nanocrystal-nanocrystal or polymer-nanocrystal distance is minimized. Furthermore, the ""electroactive"" p-orbitals of the benzenedithiol can further enhance the electronic coupling, which facilitates charge carrier dissociation and transport. On the other hand, judicious choice of ligands with appropriate molecular dipoles has a strong impact on chemical and electronic structures at the polymer-nanocrystal interface and subsequently on photovoltaic device performance. With these strategies, highly efficient polymer/CdSe nanocrystal hybrid solar cells have been achieved.

Human subjects juggled a puck in 2D through impacts with two metallic arms, requiring rhythmic bimanual actuation. The arms kinematics were only constrained by the position, velocity and time of impacts while the rest of the trajectory did not influence the movement of the puck. In order to expose the task robustness, we manipulated the task context in two distinct manners: the task tempo was assigned at four different values (hence manipulating the time available to plan and execute each impact movement individually); and vision was withdrawn during half of the trials (hence reducing the sensory inflows). We show that when the tempo was fast, the actuation was rhythmic (no pause in the trajectory) while at slow tempo, the actuation was discrete (with pause intervals between individual movements). Moreover, the withdrawal of visual information encouraged the rhythmic behavior at the four tested tempi. The discrete versus rhythmic behavior give different answers to the efficiency/robustness trade-off: discrete movements result in energy efficient movements, while rhythmic movements impact the puck with negative acceleration, a property preserving robustness. Moreover, we report that in all conditions the impact velocity of the arms was negatively correlated with the energy of the puck. This correlation tended to stabilize the task and was influenced by vision, revealing again different control strategies.

Four potential subjects refused to participate in the study. Interventions: Crutch length was adjusted using conventional guidelines, and to lengths 2.5cm above and below this setting. Oxygen consumption was measured using indirect open-circuit spirometry during the final 3 minutes of ambulation using self-selected walking speeds. Main Outcome Measure: Crutches adjusted to the convention setting are not the most efficient in terms of metabolic energy expenditure. Results: A significant reduction in oxygen rate (p = .012), oxygen cost (p = .010), and respiratory exchange ratio (p = .009) were observed when comparing crutches adjusted to -2.5cm of the standard height with conventional crutch height. Crutches adjusted 2.5cm above the standard height also required less energy, but these values failed to reach any statistical significance (p > .05). Conclusion: The importance of fitting crutches to the correct length using conventional guidelines has not been substantiated in this study. Clinically, there should be a move away from adherence to crutch-fitting criteria and more incorporation of patient feedback to fit crutches to the optimal height.

Modeling is challenging because of the limited knowledge of the fundamentals of the thermal, radiative, and fluid mechanical processes within porous media, and how these participate in the combustion process. Much of the recent interest in the field has followed the commercial availability of reticulated ceramic foams. This paper describes the structural properties of these materials, and their heat transfer properties including convective, conduction, and radiative behavior. The fluid mechanics of porous materials, relating to pressure drop and turbulence flow characteristics are presented. Flames stabilized within the matrix of a porous media have higher burning speeds and leaner flammability limits than open flames. This is due to the internal feedback of heat from the burned gases to the unburned gases through radiation and conduction through the porous medium. This ability to operate at very lean equivalence ratios also contributes to their characteristically low NO emissions. In this paper, we present experimental measurements which show the effects of the porous matrix on reaction rates, flammability limits, and flame stabilization. Exhaust emissions and radiant output from porous media burners are presented for both single-stage and multi-stage burners. The use of liquid fuels in a non-premixed mode of combustion is also discussed. Modeling the combustion process within porous media is quite complex because it requires coupled solution of the energy transfer and chemical kinetics occurring locally in the medium. We present approaches of varying sophistication which predict flame speeds, temperature and concentration profiles,and radiative efficiency.

The heading control employed on each vehicle is a discretization of the well-known Kuramoto model of nonlinearly coupled oscillators over a sequence of logical graphs. Stability for both all-to-all and random one-to-all broadcasts is shown to be dependent on the coupling strength, K, and the time discretization, Delta T. For desired system performance characteristics, Delta T imposes a tight deadline by which the state information (M bits) must be propagated through the communication network. Routing optimization with respect to minimizing energy consumption is formulated considering the Delta T deadline. Due to the tight time deadline, a one-to-all single-hop broadcasting scheme is shown to be more energy efficient for practical choices of M/Delta T. The proposed modularization is illustrated via a set of simulations where the overall communication energy to reach alignment is optimized.",,,False,,,809108,,2018-07-06 17:07:02.924494+00:00,0,False,,,Integration of communication and control using discrete time Kuramoto models for multivehicle coordination over broadcast networks,False,,,True,

Design: Positron emission tomographic (PET) studies of glucose and dopa metabolism and D-2 dopamine receptor binding the caudate nucleus and putamen of patients with PD at different Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stages using PET and the tracers (18)-F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), 6-F-18-fluoro-L-dopa (FDOPA), and C-11-raclopride (RACLO). Setting: Positron emission tomography research program at the Paul Scherrer Institute. Subjects: Twenty patients with PD at different stages of the disease (HY stages I through IV; five patients for each stage) compared with separate groups of age-matched healthy subjects. Main Outcome Measures: Influx constant (K-i) for specific FDOPA uptake; uptake index ratio for RACLO binding to D-2 dopamine receptors; normalized to global FDG metabolic rate for glucose consumption; and semiquantitative score for assessment of tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia in PD. Results: Patients with PD at HY stage I to II (hereafter HY-I-II PD) revealed reduced FDOPA metabolism, particularly in the putamen. The FDOPA uptake in the putamen and caudate nucleus declined with increasing HY staging and scoring for bradykinesia and rigidity. Putamen RACLO binding to D-2 dopamine receptors was up-regulated in patients with HY-I-II PD but declined toward control values, with increasing disease severity. Putamen side-to-side asymmetries of FDOPA metabolism and RACLO binding revealed a significant correlation. Putamen FDG metabolism showed a relative increase in all patients with PD. Conclusions: Our results show that FDOPA, RACLO, and FDG PET measurements provide complementary information to characterize metabolic and receptor changes in the striatum of PD with different degrees of motor disability. The FDOPA uptake reflects the best motor-related pathologic features, as indicated by the significant correlation between K-i values and clinical scores. The significant association between RACLO and FDOPA in the putamen suggests that D-2 dopamine receptor changes are related to the reduction of presynaptic dopaminergic nerve terminals. Putamen FDG increase is probably the result of more complex feedback mechanisms that are primarily induced by striatal dopamine deficiency.",,,False,,,809110,,2018-06-18 16:10:02.250199+00:00,0,False,,,COMPLEMENTARY POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHIC STUDIES OF THE STRIATAL DOPAMINERGIC SYSTEM IN PARKINSONS-DISEASE,False,,,True,

Although smart metering deployment has been started at the national and regional levels, there is still the question that how should the costs of deployment be allocated among stakeholders. Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is the common method for analyzing the economic feasibility of the deployment process. Starting from the CBA approach, this paper argues an efficient cost recovery scheme depends not only on the costs and benefits for each actor, but also on the interdependencies between the behavior of different actor groups. By taking a dynamic modeling approach and using System Dynamics models, this study examines the dynamics of interaction between different actors in the technology deployment process, and proposes scenarios for an efficient cost recovery. It is claimed that a dynamic view to the common Cost-Benefit Analysis approach has three advantages. First, the possibility of including actors benefiting from positive externalities or actors that can contribute to system efficiency is provided. Second, a balance can be found between the short term and long term consequences of system interventions; and finally, the development of innovative solutions, in the forms of business and policy scenarios is facilitated. The results may explain why reluctance to participate in the technology deployment process persists even after introducing dynamic pricing policies, and what factors are more critical in analyzing the cost and benefit structures of the technological system.

The instrument had been successfully used for monitoring refined sugar in many factories around the world, but its utility for raw sugar had not yet been proven at that time, so a trial was organised in collaboration with the manufacturer. The device accurately and reliably measured raw sugar colour in the process environment, and provided valuable, real-time indications of its pol (arguably the most valuable quality parameter of raw sugar) since the Colour/Impurities ratio of sugar is fairly constant from day to day, permitting pol values to be inferred from the colour measurements. It also enabled both vacuum pan capacity and energy efficiency to be increased, and molasses losses to be reduced (while maintaining quality), by reducing the recirculation of sucrose to the boiling house and avoiding over-washing in the centrifugals. The sugar stream discharged from each centrifugal was continuously monitored, permitting the identification and diagnosis of problems within and between machines and the subsequent optimisation of each centrifugal. The consequently more uniform and tighter colour feed to the back-end refinery provided more stable operations and reduced the refinery's colour load. In addition, valuable information was provided to process supervisors and other operators by broadcasting the instrument's output across the plant's SCADA system. The raw sugar boiler operator was able to monitor raw sugar colour for immediate feedback regarding massecuite quality, and to assist with decisions on boiling formulation adjustments. The mill supplies up to 90% of the raw feed to the back-end refinery, directly and without blending. Raw sugar colour and pol deviations from standard had previously caused problems in the refinery. However, following the colorimeter's installation, the refinery operators were able to use the raw colour data to proactively adjust clarification and decolourisation operating parameters to suit the incoming raws and keep their process within specification, even with reductions in supervisory staff.",,,False,,,809118,,2018-06-22 10:03:37.192195+00:00,0,False,,,"Experience and utilisation of an on-line, ColourQ, sugar colorimeter in a raw cane mill",False,,,True,

Unfortunately, their implementation and development has been severely limited by the lack of compact power supplies capable of providing the required high energy and high powers.  Integrating novel magnetic flux compression features into multistage rotating machines provides the flexible means for generating tailored, high-energy, high-power electromagnetic pulses required to efficiently drive these promising coil launchers. This paper presents advanced concepts of high energy power supplies for coil launchers.  These concepts are designed to produce high inductive compression ratios and large current and magnetic field multiplication ratios in the range of megamperes of current and gigawatts of active power.  As a consequence of the flexibility of multiwinding rotating generators, such designs provide an extensive range of output pulse shaping in single or multiple pulses, enabling optimum operation of the coil launcher. The interaction of different stationary and rotating electrical windings in strong magnetic fields with feedback generated amplification and nonuniform compensation of the armature reaction is the key to providing a large and flexible spectrum of tailored output pulses, eliminating the need for switching and other large external electromagnetic pulse forming components. Dynamic interactions between the internal impedance of these generators, and the induced electromotive forces in various windings, as well as the role of the external passive circuit components introduced in the launcher circuit, such as capacitors and inductors, are discussed and numerically evaluated.

The system integration of the increasing amount of variable electricity generation is therefore a highly important task. This paper focuses on a residential quarter with PV systems and explores how heat pumps and thermal and electrical storages can help to integrate the PV generation through self-consumption. However, self-consumption and PV integration are not only affected by technologies but also by pricing mechanisms. This paper therefore analyses the impact of different tariffs on the investment and operation decisions in a residential quarter and its interaction with the external grid. The considered tariffs include a standard fixed per-kilowatt-hour price, a dynamic pricing scheme and a capacity pricing scheme. To account for the interdependent uncertainties of energy supply, demand and electricity prices, we use a module-based framework including a Markov process and a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer program. Analysing a residential quarter in Southern Germany as a case study, we find that the integration of a PV system is economically advantageous for all considered tariffs. The self-consumption rate varies between 58 and 75%. The largest PV system is built when dynamic prices are applied.

The therapeutic effect would depend on several bound mechanisms, in keeping with our fundamental relation with the natural environment and socio-relational purposes supported by a nonintrusive support of low complexity. Formal scientific clinical studies began in psychiatry in reactive disorders. We want to consolidate the clinical impressions accumulated in practice care in the suffering hospitalized adult of a severe pathology, through a pilot study of a qualitative type using the content analysis of interviews in a short form. The method consists of exploring elements of their comments through a feedback of personal experiences within a small group of patients to identify recurring and shared issues. Then, a structural synthesis of central elements of described experience aims at understanding the patient unique experience meanwhile and perceive the meaning for them. We began the investigation with 7 patients. The clinical evaluation was based on a semi structured interview lasting 20-30 minutes with the help of an interview guide collecting experience. The personal experience of the patient once re-written has been analyzed. The first step of qualitative data confirms the assumption of a device of care supporting the process of recovery, the benefit in a reduction of perception of symptoms of the disease, the impression to get back on their feet, the interest of a differently perceived relation with caregivers, the advantage of a resumption of the power to act, and the recognition of the importance of the support from others. Therefore patients state a re-start of their physical or psychic energy. It can be understood with the support of the group as well as the direct effects of the vegetal, or more, with discovering new possibilities to enable them to rebound back into daily life. Then, they can describe that whenever the caregiver goes to the same level as the patient in charge, and that he agrees to be taught and surprised by what the other knows, he restores on a making-together method a failing self-esteem. This feeling of self-efficiency, highlighted by human interaction with a newly renamed caregiver, enables people to get past feeling stigmatized even if this feeling is unfortunately deeply buried in the person. If the feeling of worthlessness and impossibility to change give way to a slightest action, a dynamic settles down. It enables the patient to get aware that it can act and influence on its environment, like the others. As a result, the feeling of inadequacy decreases and even the slightest result enable to recover self-confidence thanks to a positive environment. It doesn't take much for them to realize they can act and widen their experience to other areas of their lives. The feeling of the ability to act by themselves comes back. Finally the relationship with others seems a key element in the Healing Garden. It can be shared between peers, between caregivers and patients, between the relationships of these people with the rest of society. The matter is the acceptance of its own abilities even if they are diminished. This perspective cannot be separated from the above mentioned elements: The achievement is team work and overtake individual boundaries. It allows the patient. It is the feedback of society over creation and work performed. The feeling of self-efficiency created by the pride they can feel is reward and may lead to other achievement. To conclude, we propose to consider the thematic emergence of the experience of the concept of vitality as spring action in the real in front of others as echo in a psychopathologic tradition dedicated to the existential comprehension of disorders.

The originality is in that patients acquire resources from the environment, in a dynamic recovery. So we suggest offering this mediation as soon as possible to curb the spread of their illness.

However, without any particular optimization, preamble sampling protocols still consume large amounts of energy due to the overhead induced by the long preamble transmitted prior data frames. To reduce the overhead induced by the useafull length preamble, many improvements have been proposed. These proposals targeted both the cost at the receiver and that at the transmitter. At the transmitter side, proposals tends to minimize the preamble size by means of explicit synchronization, whereas at the receiver, proposals aim at reducing the duration of listening by replacing the preamble with a series of frames. In this paper, we focus on reducing the cost at the receiver side while showing that our solution is also compatible with solutions that reduce the cost at the transmitter side. We propose a new idea that reduces overhearing further on by avoiding reception of irrelevant frames. With our idea that is based on digest information, not only unicast frames can be filtered but also irrelevant (redundant) broadcast frames can be avoided a priori. We show that the use of the digest information together with the sequence number field substantially increases the energy savings of frame preamble MAC protocols. We propose two possible implementations, Micro Frame Preamble (MFP) and Zebra Frame Preamble (ZFP), in which avoiding reception of irrelevant broadcasts can be integrated.

However, in high internal load buildings, such as offices, internal gains can easily lead to overheating. Thermal inertia (TI) and night ventilation have a great potential for reducing heat loads and temperature. However, their influence is difficult to predict due to the complex nature of the TI phenomenon, which is related to the interactions of multiple factors such as architecture, building physics and external conditions. Moreover, TI efficacy has often been studied in relation to energy savings or temperature analysis, overlooking other aspects implicated in buildings' efficiency, such as the embodied energy involved. This paper presents a multidimensional approach to evaluate ventilative cooling and thermal inertia as a sustainable strategy to improve building performances. To that end, several scenarios of night ventilation strategies have been applied to the case study of an experimental double-office room placed in Fribourg (Switzerland). Based on this monitoring, a dynamic software simulation tool has been calibrated and used to analyze the energy savings potential and the life cycle performance of TI. A new ratio index has been introduced to easily evaluate the life cycle efficiency. The results show the importance of balancing operational and embodied impacts when evaluating a design choice. Although high TI levels have great benefits on reducing the cooling loads, the results are completely different when a life cycle assessment is applied. Natural ventilation coupled with middle levels of TI have been identified as the best strategy to optimize the building's energy and environmental performances, without compromising indoor temperatures.

Despite the rooting of default rules in subconscious decision-making, this research finds that, ultimately, awareness drives the demand necessary for the creation of sustainable consumption. Whereas direct appeal to individuals has a disappointing level of influence on sustainability choices, it is understood that green consumers do come from somewhere. Green default rules offer interesting prospects for sidestepping the drawbacks of direct marketing to individuals. Under green default rules, behavior is guided by a default, such as utilities automatically sending customers renewables-sourced instead of fossil-fuel-based energy. To act otherwise requires additional effort and is less likely. Motivated by a need to understand how defaults might bridge standards and sustainable consumption, I investigate how organizational processes potentially lead from standardized green default rules to individual awareness that can spread and facilitate sustainable consumption.

Luminescent spectral conversion provides a mechanism to manipulate and to adapt the incident solar spectrum by converting, through photoluminescence, the energies of solar photons into those that are more effectively captured by a PV device. This mechanism is particularly helpful for DSSCs because there is much flexibility in both the choice of the light-harvesting materials and the architecture of the DSSC. Here we review and discuss recent advances in the field of luminescent spectral conversion for DSSCs.

Thus, the existing electrical grid may reach its physical limits. To counteract this, and to fully exploit the viable potential of renewables, grid-balancing measures are crucial. In this work, battery storage systems are embedded in a grid simulation to evaluate their potential for grid balancing. The overall setup is based on a real, low-voltage distribution grid topology, real smart meter household load profiles, and real photovoltaics load data. An autonomous optimization routine, driven by a one-way communicated incentive, determines the prospective battery operation mode. Different battery positions and incentives are compared to evaluate their impact.

This novel technique also has the benefit of reduced computational burdens by improving computational efficiency over conventional NFSMC and thus suitable for real-time industrial applications. The parameters of the modified neuro-fuzzy control are tuned by an adaptive mechanism based on sliding-mode control.

Mathematical modelling of different types of appliances has been done to achieve the required results. Time of use tariff and day ahead real time pricing tariff have been used for energy scheduling. A wind energy source has been considered to reduce the burden of energy demand on the grids and to analyse the effect of renewable energy sources in a small scale energy management problem. A delay factor has been also included in the main objective function of the problem to maintain the satisfaction level of the consumers by reducing cost of waiting. The final designed problem is solved by mixed integer linear programming technique using GAMS software. The time taken for the solution is very less. In this paper, to increase the energy efficiency and the accuracy of the required results, the selected time horizon of 24h is divided into 96 small time slots, each of 15min duration.

An arm composed of several segments presents a geometric redundancy. Thus, selecting one trajectory among an infinite number of possible ones requires overcoming redundancy, according to some kinds of optimization. Solving this optimization is assumed to be the function of BG in planning. In the proposed model, first, a mathematical solution of kinematic planning is proposed for movements of a redundant arm in a plane, based on minimizing energy consumption. Next, the function of each part in the model is interpreted as a possible role of a nucleus of BG. Since the kinematic variables are considered as vectors, the proposed model is presented based on the vector calculus. This vector model predicts different neuronal populations in BG which is in accordance with some recent experimental studies. According to the proposed model, the function of the direct pathway is to calculate the necessary rotation of each joint, and the function of the indirect pathway is to control each joint rotation considering the movement of the other joints. In the proposed model, the local feedback loop between Subthalamic Nucleus and Globus Pallidus extemus is interpreted as a local memory to store the previous amounts of movements of the other joints, which are utilized by the indirect pathway. In this model, activities of dopaminergic neurons would encode, at short-term, the error between the desired and actual positions of the end effector. The short-term modulating effect of dopamine on Striatum is also modeled as cross product. The model is simulated to generate the commands of a redundant manipulator. The performance of the model is studied for different reaching movements between 8 points in a plane.

In previous studies, participants used these effectively when they were explicitly asked to drive fuel-efficiently. In contrast, they used their safe driving skills when they were instructed to drive as they would normally. Hence, it is assumed that many drivers choose not to engage purposefully in eco-driving in their everyday lives. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of simple, periodic text messages (nine messages in 2 weeks) on drivers' eco- and safe driving performance. It was hypothesised that provision of eco-driving primes and advice would encourage the activation of their eco-driving mental models and that comparable safety primes increase driving safety. For this purpose, a driving simulator experiment was conducted. All participants performed a pre-test drive and were then randomly divided into four groups, which received different interventions. For a period of 2 weeks, one group received text messages with eco-driving primes and another group received safety primes. A third group received advice messages on how to eco-drive. The fourth group were instructed by the experimenter to drive fuel-efficiently, immediately before driving, with no text message intervention. A post-test drive measured behavioural changes in scenarios deemed relevant to eco- and safe driving. The results suggest that the eco-driving prime and advice text messages did not have the desired effect. In comparison, asking drivers to drive fuel-efficiently led to eco-driving behaviours.

To group as many as several million customers into small ""comparison groups"", an automated method must be developed drawing solely from the data available to the utility. This paper develops and applies methods to compare the quality of resulting comparison groups. A data base of 114,000 customers from a utility billing system was used to evaluate Innovative Billing comparison groups, comparing four alternative criteria: house characteristics (floor area, housing type, and heating fuel); street; meter read route; billing cycle. Also, customers were interviewed to see what forms of comparison graphs made most sense and led to fewest errors of interpretation. We find that good quality comparison groups result from using street name, meter book, or multiple house characteristics. Other criteria we tested, such as entire cycle, entire meter book, or single house characteristics such as floor area, resulted in poor quality comparison groups. This analysis provides a basis for choosing comparison groups based on extensive user testing and statistical analysis.

This study presents a large-scale field experiment within the USDA's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) that examines whether informational outreach, including behavioral nudges, could improve land owners' willingness to participate. The experiment evaluates the impact of three types of reminder letters on the rate at which land is offered into the CRP.

We do not detect any differences in the estimated treatment effects among the basic reminder letter and the letters augmented with peer comparisons and social norm messaging, nor do we detect any treatment effect among currently unenrolled farms. From a policy perspective, these results imply that the USDA can generate additional CRP offers among farms with expiring contracts at an average cost of $ 39 per additional offer. Assuming a twenty-five million acre program, reminder letters sent during every sign-up period would result in re-enrollment offers from an additional 420,000 acres.

Using this system, we applied select combinations of biological muscle activation (modulated with rate-coded direct neural stimulation) and parallel elastic assistance (applied via closed-loop mechanical environment simulation) hypothesized to mimic human behavior based on previously published modeling studies. These conditions resulted in constant system-level force-length dynamics (i.e., stiffness), reduced biological loads, increased muscle excursion, and constant muscle average positive power output all consistent with laboratory experiments on intact humans during exoskeleton assisted hopping. Mechanical assistance led to reduced estimated metabolic cost and MTU apparent efficiency, but increased apparent efficiency for the MTU + Exo system as a whole. Findings from this study suggest that the increased natural resonant frequency of the artificially stiffened MTU + Exo system, along with invariant movement frequencies, may underlie observed limits on the benefits of exoskeleton assistance. Our novel approach demonstrates that it is possible to capture the salient features of human locomotion with exoskeleton assistance in an isolated muscle-tendon preparation, and introduces a powerful new tool for detailed, direct examination of how assistive devices affect muscle-level neuromechanics and energetics.

This paper assesses ex ante the effects of free riding on the cost-effectiveness of a rebate program that promotes the adoption of energy-efficient heating systems, relying on contingent valuation choice experiments carried out through identical representative surveys in eight EU Members States. The analysis distinguishes between strong and weak free riders: strong free riders already plan to adopt a new heating system in the next five years; weak free riders decide to purchase once propositioned with an attractive technology package (and therefore do not require a rebate to adopt). The reservation rebates for incentivized adopters (those who decide to adopt because of a rebate) differ substantially across countries. On average, they amount to approximately 40% of the heating system's purchasing price, suggesting generally high opportunity costs for premature upgrades. The reservation rebate and weak free-ridership vary with income, risk and time preferences, and environmental identity. At a rebate level that corresponds to half the purchase price of the offered heating system, the estimated share of free riders exceeded 50% for most countries, with a typically higher share of weak free riders than strong free riders. Specific rebate cost estimates (in sic/tCO(2)) differ considerably across countries, suggesting that cooperation can yield budgetary benefits. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In these strategies, periodic adjustments would be made in the airspeed and/or heading angle command for the unmanned aerial vehicle to minimize a projected power requirement at some future time. In this paper, unmanned aerial vehicle flights are described by a three-dimensional dynamic point mass. Onboard closed-loop trajectory tracking logics that follow airspeed vector commands are modeled using the method of feedback linearization. A generic wind field model is assumed that consists of a constant term plus terms that vary sinusoidally with respect to the location. To evaluate the benefits of these strategies in enhancing unmanned aerial vehicle flight endurance, a reference strategy is introduced in which the unmanned aerial vehicle would seek to follow the desired airspeed in a steady level flight under zero wind. A performance measure is defined as the average power consumption both over a specified time interval and over different initial heading angles of the unmanned aerial vehicle. A relative benefit criterion is then defined as the percentage improvement of the performance measure of a proposed strategy over that of the reference strategy.

As an effective tool to improve reliability, stability, and financial efficiency of the power grids, demand response (DR) has brought significant financial and technical benefits to power systems. As one of the price-based DR programs with less control costs, the time-of-use (TOU) program has been applied as the default rate structure by many utility companies. To avoid financial risks and make the most profit from the market, utility companies treat TOU as an effective strategy to change customers' electricity consumption patterns. As reported in many literature, existing TOU programs are not as effective as expected in many developed countries due to the complexity of human behaviors and disparities of residential customers. To examine whether to obtain different outcomes of TOU on the residential customers in developing countries, actual utility usage data from residential consumers in Shanghai, China, are analyzed in this paper. The result shows current TOU in Shanghai, China, has similar trends as TOU in developed countries.

Household Energy Storage (HES) and Community Energy Storage (CES) are two promising storage scenarios for residential electricity prosumers. This paper aims to assess and compare the technical and economic feasibility of both HES and CES. To do that, mathematical optimization is used in both scenarios, where a Home Energy Management System (HEMS) schedules the allocation of energy from the PV system, battery and the grid in order to satisfy the power demand of households using a dynamic pricing scheme.

The study ran for one year; each driver was engaged in the experiment for four weeks. Narrowly defined, ecodriving represents the set of behaviors that a driver can use to minimize the energy use of a trip after the trip has begun. The general ecodriving behaviors are moderating acceleration, top speed, and braking. Ecodriving has long been recognized as a potential source of reductions in transportation energy use, with reduction estimates ranging widely from less than 5% to over 20% depending on context. In-vehicle feedback that provides drivers with salient information suited to their personal goals may be one way to motivate ecodriving. Although many studies have tested unique feedback designs, little research has been conducted into the cognitive precursors to driver behavior change that may underlie the adoption or rejection of ecodriving practices, and therefore underlie the effectiveness of any feedback design. This study examines both precursor cognitive factors and driver behavior changes with the introduction of energy feedback, using a framework hypothesizing that attitudes, social norms, perceived control, and goals influence behavior and behavior change. The study finds that the introduction of a feedback interface can both activate these cognitive factors and result in behavior change. Furthermore, the study finds that there was an overall 4.4% reduction in fuel consumption due entirely to one group that showed increases in their knowledge of fuel economy and reported high levels of technical proficiency during the experiment. Statistically significant relationships are found in this group between the magnitude of cognitive change and the magnitude of behavior change-supporting the theoretical framework. The second group made no improvement and may have been confused by the feedback.

Based on data collection, prediction and a certain objectives, the expert system in a CEMS can work out the optimization schedule, after this, the voltage droop control for steady voltage is aligned with the command of the unit power schedule. In this work, a DC RDS is used as a case study to demonstrate the process, the RDS is associated with unit economic models, and a cost minimization objective is proposed that is to be achieved based on the real-time electrical price.

Policy makers and program managers need to better understand consumers' perceptions of their energy use and savings to design effective strategies for promoting energy savings. Methods. We reviewed 14 studies from the emerging interdisciplinary literature examining consumers' perceptions electricity use by specific appliances, and potential savings. Results. We find that: (1) electricity use is often overestimated for low-energy consuming appliances, and underestimated for high-energy consuming appliances; (2) curtailment strategies are typically preferred over energy efficiency strategies; (3) consumers lack information about how much electricity can be saved through specific strategies; (4) consumers use heuristics for assessing the electricity use of specific appliances, with some indication that more accurate judgments are made among consumers with higher numeracy and stronger pro-environmental attitudes. However, design differences between studies, such as variations in reference points, reporting units and assessed time periods, may affect consumers' reported perceptions. Moreover, studies differ with regard to whether accuracy of perceptions was evaluated through comparisons with general estimates of actual use, self-reported use, household-level meter readings, or real-time smart meter readings. Conclusion. Although emerging findings are promising, systematic variations in the measurement of perceived and actual electricity use are potential cause for concern. We propose avenues for future research, so as to better understand, and possibly inform, consumers' perceptions of their electricity use.

In order to quantify PRAC's performance in terms of both throughput and energy efficiency, experiments are conducted using commercial transceivers in two different scenarios. Our implementation results reveal that PRAC offers an average throughput gain of 35% compared with a baseline ARQ scheme discarding partial packets, and 13% compared with an ideal hybrid-ARQ scheme.

The considered mathematical models can describe a large number of practical systems in the actual engineering. In particular, all of the information exchanges are modeled by a sample-and-hold mechanism, which is more reliable and practical in applications. Moreover, this framework can deal with time-varying transmission delays and data packet dropouts by taking into account the limited communication capacity of information exchanges. By utilizing model transformation and applying the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, sufficient conditions are first established with single-packet information exchanges to ensure that the networked Euler-Lagrange systems can achieve consensus under undirected communication topology. Then, the obtained results are further extended to the multiple-packet transmission case. Finally, an example of four two-link manipulators with time-varying transmission delays and data packet dropouts is addressed to verify the effectiveness and applicability of our theoretical results.

This study examines factors influencing consumers' participation in voluntary TOU programs with particular attention to individual-specific risk and time preferences elicited through multiple price-list experiments. Evidence from a study of 398 homeowners in Arizona and California, U.S., indicates that more risk averse consumers are less likely to enroll in TOU programs. The results suggest evidence of adverse selection, with households who consume less energy during peak hours being more likely to enroll in TOU programs. Time preferences are found to have a statistically significant and negative impact on consumers' adoption of programmable thermostats, a technology that can allow households to better respond to TOU pricing. However, we find no evidence that consumers' decisions to enroll in TOU programs and adopt programmable thermostats are correlated.

The eco-feedback information is delivered using mobile app, which provides a higher level of accessibility than other eco-feedback technologies. A prototype app-based eco-feedback system was developed in this study, and used in an experiment that was carried out in student dormitories.

634,762,2016,WOS:000389089000069,,False,"Demand response (DR) can serve as an effective tool to better balance the electricity demand and supply in the smart grid. It is defined as ""the changes in electricity usage by end-use customers from their normal consumption patterns"" in response to pricing and incentive payments. This paper focuses on new opportunities for DR with electric vehicles (EVs). EVs are potential distributed energy resources that support both the grid-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-grid modes. Their participation in the time-based (e.g., time-of-use) and incentive-based (e.g., regulation services) DR programs helps improve the stability and reduce the potential risks to the grid. Smart scheduling of EV charging and discharging activities also supports high penetration of renewables with volatile energy generation. This paper proposes a novel stochastic model from the Independent System Operator's perspective for risk management and participation planning of EVs in the smart grid for DR. The risk factors considered in this paper involve those caused by uncertainties in renewables (wind and solar), load patterns, parking patterns, and transmission lines' reliability. The effectiveness of the model in response to various settings such as the area type (residential, commercial, and industrial), the EV penetration level, and the risk level has been investigated.

Multiple energy procurement sources containing pool market (PM), bilateral contracts (BCs), distributed generation (DG) units, renewable energy sources (photovoltaic (PV) system and wind turbine (WT)) and energy storage system (ESS) as well as demand response program (DRP) as virtual generation unit are considered. The scenario-based stochastic framework is used for uncertainty modeling of pool market prices, client group demand and variable climate condition containing temperature, irradiation and wind speed. In the proposed model, the selling price is determined and compared by the retailer in the smart grid in three cases containing fixed pricing, time-of-use (TOU) pricing and real-time pricing (RTP). It is shown that the selling price determination based on RTP by the retailer leads to higher expected profit. Furthermore, demand response program (DRP) has been implemented to flatten the load profile to minimize the cost for end-user customers as well as increasing the retailer profit. To validate the proposed model, three case studies are used and the results are compared. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines the effectiveness of policy incentives to increase residential solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity. We use county-level panel data and control for demographic characteristics, solar resources, and pro-environmental preferences. Results show that among financial incentives, rebates have the most impact with an additional $1 per watt rebate increasing annual PV capacity additions by close to 50%. Factors that affect financial returns to solar PV such as electricity price and solar insolation are also found to be significant. Results also point to a significant positive relationship between hybrid vehicle sales and residential PV capacity growth, indicating the importance of pro-environmental preferences as a predictor of solar PV demand. Back of the envelope calculations suggest that the cost of carbon mitigation through rebates is around $184 per ton of CO2. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

To facilitate the knowledge of the energy performance of existing non-residential buildings and the choice of the more adequate actions, Public Administrations (PA) should have the availability of proper tools. Within the Italian project ""POI 2007-13"", a database and a decision support tool, for easy use, even to a non-technical user, have been developed.

Many studies have demonstrated the positive influence of socially contextualized feedback on the energy consumption of households, but not many such studies dealt with the specifics of low-income households. This paper evaluates the effect of customized consumption feedback and other information interactions on energy-behaviour patterns and energy savings in low-income households. The experimentation process was accompanied by an interactive awareness campaign, with the emphasis being on a proper understanding of the consumption feedback and other complementary energy services provided to low-income households. The feedback actions were customized to tackle the recognised needs of each specific target household, considering both the social aspects and the typology of the dwelling.

A multi-stage stochastic programming is proposed from the demand side in order to understand the rational decisions. The consumer preferences are modeled as a risk-averse function under additive uncertainty. The user chooses the optimal consumption profile to maximize his economic benefits for each period. The stochastic optimization problem is solved backward in time. A particular situation is developed when the system operator (SO) uses consumption of the previous interval as the household-specific baseline for the DR program. It is found that a rational consumer alters the baseline in order to increase the well-being when there is an economic incentive. As results, whether the incentive is lower than the retail price, the user shifts his load requirement to the baseline setting period. On the other hand, if the incentive is greater than the regular energy price, the optimal decision is that the user spends the maximum possible energy in the baseline setting period and reduces the consumption at the PTR time. This consumer behavior produces more energy consumption in total considering all periods. In addition, the user with high uncertainty level in his energy pattern should spend less energy than a predictable consumer when the incentive is lower than the retail price. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Findings identified opportunities for energy savings (both behavioural and operational) as well as load shifting across most product categories, however, in many instances other potential benefits related to convenience, comfort, or security may limit the realisation of savings.

Additionally, we investigate the influence of individuals' financial loss aversion and financial risk preferences on this valuation. In our study we conduct a choice experiment survey in which respondents' choices indicate the value they place on avoiding wind, solar, and biomass externalities. We combine this survey with a financial lottery choice task that elicits the respondents' risk preferences and degree of loss aversion. In the choice experiment we use both increases and decreases in electricity bills to depict the uncertain effect of new sources of energy generation on the current price level. This design allows us to investigate if obtained values are independent of the payment mechanism. In the analyzed context, our results indicate that marginal utility of money seems to be lower with a rebate on the energy bill than with a surcharge. We find that financial risk preferences affect people's choices both in a case of a surcharge and a rebate, while loss aversion for money affects them just in the case of a rebate. Loss aversion for money seems to not be present during a buying process. The results indicate that the more risk seeking people are in a financial domain the more they are willing to pay for proposed changes in renewable energy development, at the same time people who are more risk averse require less compensation before they accept externalities from renewable electricity production. Moreover, a higher compensation is required by people who are more loss averse with regard to money. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

These contracts are supposed to encourage users to shift power consumption during peak hours to help balance the load in the power system. Of all the available contracts in Sweden, monthly-average price holds the largest share, in response to the low electricity prices during the last three years. It is not clear if RTP will become a popular dynamic pricing scheme since daily price fluctuations might keep customers away from this type of contract.

This paper studies the economic impact if customers would shift to RTP contracts without adopting demand-side management. To achieve this, electricity costs from a large group of households were calculated and compared between both pricing schemes using the hourly consumption data of a 7-year period. Results suggest that the RTP electricity contract offer a considerable economic savings potential even without enabling consumer demand-side management. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

First, compared to the conventional UHF RFID tags, the proposed tag shows the advantage of higher transmission data rate with still low power consumption. The response time in multi-tag accessing scenarios can be reduced to less than 500 ms per 1000 tags by the pipeline of the tag responses in IR-UWB link and the reader acknowledgments in UHF RFID link as well as by reducing the length of empty slots.

648,780,2016,WOS:000386983000036,,False,"Many applications in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) require all data to be transmitted with minimal or without loss, what implies that reliability is an important characteristic. In any WSN, there are two basic approaches to recover erroneous packets. One way is to use Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ), and another is Forward Error Correction (FEC). The error-control systems for applications based on ARQ use error detection coupled with retransmission requests to maximize reliability at some cost to throughput. Error detection is generally provided by the lower protocol layers which use checksums (e.g. Cyclic Redundancy Checksums (CRCs)) to discard corrupted packets and trigger retransmission requests. In these solutions event a single erroneous bit can render a packet useless to the end user. Having in mind that in WSNs the power is scarce and is primarily consumed by wireless transmission and reception, we propose to use FEC rather than ARQ, FEC is a way of correcting packets by transmitting additional information bits with aim to reduce the frequency of retransmission requests. During this, data bytes are optionally encoded after being fragmented with Error Correcting Code (ECC) to recover data bits in case of small number of bit errors. Various FEC encoding schemes such as erasure and Hamming based codes are available. The choice of the encoding schemes depends on the applications and error characteristics (error models/patterns) of the wireless channel. Erasure encoding is preferable for usage when the error pattern is burst dominated, while Hamming encoding when noise causes random errors. Our observations show that most bit errors are single-bit or double-bit errors and burst errors are present but rare. In this work, an efficient Hamming based FEC encoding scheme of relatively low complexity called Two Dimensional-Single Error Correcting-Double Error Detecting (2D-SEC-DED), intended to minimize packet retransmissions and to save energy, has been developed. Such FEC scheme can be used to correct all single-bit and 99.99%of double/multiple-bit errors. Since the radio block is dominant energy consumer within a Sensor Node (SN), we focus our attention to answer the question: which is the adequate metric to use, and under what conditions to accurately characterize the quality of the communication, related to reliable data transfer, with minimal energy consumption. To this end, as first, in a case when the bit error is not high and most errors are single-bit, we show that 2D SEC-DED encoding scheme is more energy efficient in comparison to erasure encoding. As second, the advantages of using 2D-SEC-DED in respect to CRC (NO-FEC) encoding, concerning decreasing the energy consumption and increasing the reliability of the radio block are derived through implementation of two versions of the Rendezvous Protocol for Long Living (RPLL) referred as Modified-RPLL (M-RPLL as FEC based) and Ordinary-RPLL (O-RPLL as NO-FEC), respectively.

In the case of the effectively two-level system, which has been realized experimentally based on tunneling of individual electron in a single-electron box , we also studied and minimized corrections to the ideal reversible operation of the demon. These corrections include, in particular, the non-adiabatic terms which are described by a version of the classical fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The overall reversibility of the Maxwell's demon requires, beside the reversibility of the intrinsic working body dynamics, the reversibility of the measurement, and feedback processes.

A total of 39 students from 10 different countries who shared four university dormitories were recruited in an experiment.

In this paper a mathematical model of human behavioural dynamic interactions on a social network is derived to calculate energy savings. This model consists of a weighted directed network with time evolving information on each node. Energy savings from the whole network is expressed as mathematical expectation from probability theory. This expected energy savings model includes both direct and indirect energy savings of individuals in the network. The savings model is obtained by network weights and modified by the decay of information. Expected energy savings are calculated for cases where individuals in the social network are treated as a single information source or multiple sources. This model is tested on a social network consisting of 40 people. The results show that the strength of relations between individuals is more important to information diffusion than the number of connections individuals have. The expected energy savings of optimally chosen node can be 25.32% more than randomly chosen nodes at the end of the second month for the case of single information source in the network, and 16.96% more than random nodes for the case of multiple information sources.

Such databases, often called embedded databases, are supposed to provide timely data services under various constraints, such as limited time and energy. However, current embedded databases do not support timely and energy-efficient processing of transactions. Further, most existing academic results from real-time and embedded databases depend on the adaptation of quality-of-data (QoD) and admission control techniques to achieve timeliness. However, the range of QoD adaptation is often limited by the requirements of applications. We might consider different tuning knobs exposed by modern embedded systems, such as dynamic voltage/frequency scaling (DVFS), since they can be applied to control the latency of transactions without degrading QoD as far as the system is not overloaded. However, since DVFS has only a few discrete voltage/frequency steps, fine-grained control to support desired response time is hard to achieve.

It is difficult to account for this uncertainty in the design phase when operational and occupancy profiles are unknown. The relevant ""performance gap"" usually encountered between simulated and measured energy performance is clearly connected to biased assumptions in modeling, especially in the initial design phase. A probabilistic modeling approach is proposed to improve simulation reliability and robustness with respect to variability in occupancy patterns. The case study presented is the eLUX lab of the ""Smart Campus"" of Brescia University in Italy. Occupancy dependent input parameters such as air change rates (i.e. mechanically controlled ventilation) and internal heat gains (i.e. due to people, lighting and appliances) are described by means of probability distributions to obtain probabilistic thermal demand and load profiles as output. Probabilistic results enables a more reliable identification of energy saving strategies (operational and environmental settings) with respect to highly variable operating conditions. Further, simulation data are processed to obtain a weather-adjusted energy demand visualization, suitable for establishing a continuity between modeling in design and operation phases, with calibration purpose.

However, its building-group level performance, which is the real concern to grid, has not been systematically evaluated. Thus, using operation data of real buildings, this study evaluates performance of conventional demand response at building-group-level under common electricity pricings. The evaluation results disclose major limitations of conventional demand response due to lack of coordination. Under time of use pricing, conventional HVAC demand response cannot effectively and efficiently reduce peak demand at building-group-level.

The study concluded that reduction in the cost of storage medium has more impact on economic viability than increasing only peak price of electricity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These technologies enable the control of residential consumption, local small-scale generation, and energy storage systems to respond to time-varying prices. However, shifting loads simultaneously to lower price periods is likely to put extra stress on distribution system assets such as distribution transformers. Especially, additional new types of loads/appliances such as electric vehicles (EVs) can introduce even more burden on the operation of these assets, which is an issue that needs special attention. Such extra stress can cause accelerated aging of distribution system assets and significantly affect the reliability of the system.

These techniques use a combination of periodic model filters and, possibly periodic, masking filters. Time-multiplexing is in general beneficial since only rarely does the technology bound maximum obtainable clock frequency and the application determined required sample rate correspond. Therefore, architectures for time-multiplexed FRM filters that benefit from the inherent sparsity of the periodic filters are introduced in this paper. We show that FRM filters not only reduce the number of multipliers needed, but also have benefits in terms of memory usage. Despite the total amount of samples to be stored is larger for FRM, it results in fewer memory resources needed in FPGAs and more energy efficient memory schemes in ASICs. In total, the power consumption is significantly reduced compared with a single-stage implementation.

We advance and complement this important field of energy research through an innovative methodology that characterises the energy consumption of domestic life by making the linkages between appliance end-use and activities through an ontology built from qualitative data about the household and NILM data. We use activities as a descriptive term for the common ways households spend their time at home. These activities, such as cooking or laundering, are meaningful to households' own lived experience. Thus, besides strictly technical algorithmic approaches for processing quantitative smart meter data, we also draw on social science time use approaches and interview and ethnography data. Our method disaggregates a households total electricity load down to appliance level and provides the start time, duration, and total electricity consumption for each occurrence of appliance usage. We then make inferences about activities occurring in the home by combining these disaggregated data with an ontology that formally specifies the relationships between electricity-using appliances and activities. We also propose two novel standardised metrics to enable easy quantifiable comparison within and across households of the energy intensity and routine of activities of interest.

Due to the low photon energy at the short-wave infrared (SWIR), photon detection and imaging at this band are very challenging. As such, many efforts in photon detector research are directed toward improving the performance of the photon detectors operating in this wavelength range. To solve these problems, we have developed an electron-injection (EI) technique. The significance of this detection mechanism is that it can provide both high efficiency and high sensitivity at room temperature, a condition that is very difficult to achieve in conventional SWIR detectors. An EI detector offers an overall system-level sensitivity enhancement due to a feedback stabilized internal avalanche-free gain. Devices exhibit an excess noise of unity, operate in linear mode, require bias voltage of a few volts, and have a cutoff wavelength of 1700 nm. We review the material system, operating principle, and development of EI detectors. The shortcomings of the first-generation devices were addressed in the second-generation detectors. Measurement on second-generation devices showed a high-speed response of similar to 6 ns rise time, low jitter of less than 20 ps, high amplification of more than 2000 (at optical power levels larger than a few nW), unity excess noise factor, and low leakage current (amplified dark current similar to 10 nA at a bias voltage of -3 V and at room temperature. These characteristics make EI detectors a good candidate for high-resolution flash light detection and ranging (LiDAR) applications with millimeter scale depth resolution at longer ranges compared with conventional p-i-n diodes. Based on our experimentally measured device characteristics, we compare the performance of the EI detector with commercially available linear mode InGaAs avalanche photodiode (APD) as well as a p-i-n diode using a theoretical model. Flash LiDAR images obtained by our model show that the EI detector array achieves better resolution with higher signal-to-noise compared with both the InGaAs APD and the p-i-n array (of 100 x 100 elements).

Analog neuromorphic hardware constitutes a fast and energy-efficient substrate for the implementation of such neural computing architectures in technical applications and neuroscientific research. The functional performance of neural networks is often critically dependent on the level of correlations in the neural activity. In finite networks, correlations are typically inevitable due to shared presynaptic input. Recent theoretical studies have shown that inhibitory feedback, abundant in biological neural networks, can actively suppress these shared-input correlations and thereby enable neurons to fire nearly independently. For networks of spiking neurons, the decorrelating effect of inhibitory feedback has so far been explicitly demonstrated only for homogeneous networks of neurons with linear subthreshold dynamics. Theory, however, suggests that the effect is a general phenomenon, present in any system with sufficient inhibitory feedback, irrespective of the details of the network structure or the neuronal and synaptic properties. Here, we investigate the effect of network heterogeneity on correlations in sparse, random networks of inhibitory neurons with nonlinear, conductance-based synapses. Emulations of these networks on the analog neuromorphic-hardware system Spikey allow us to test the efficiency of decorrelation by inhibitory feedback in the presence of hardware-specific heterogeneities. The configurability of the hardware substrate enables us to modulate the extent of heterogeneity in a systematic manner. We selectively study the effects of shared input and recurrent connections on correlations in membrane potentials and spike trains. Our results confirm that shared-input correlations are actively suppressed by inhibitory feedback also in highly heterogeneous networks exhibiting broad, heavy-tailed firing-rate distributions. In line with former studies, cell heterogeneities reduce shared-input correlations.

In this study, the performance including equivalent full cycles and round trip efficiency of lead-acid (PbA) and lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries performing demand load shifting are quantified as a function of the size of the community using simulation-based optimisation. Two different retail tariffs are compared: a time-of-use tariff (Economy 7) and a real-time-pricing tariff including four periods ""based on the electricity prices on the wholesale market. Additionally, the economic benefits are quantified when projected to two different years: 2020 and a hypothetical zero carbon year. The findings indicate that the optimum PbA capacity was approximately twice the optimum Li-ion capacity in the case of the real-time-pricing tariff and around 1.6 times for Economy 7 for any community size except a single home. The levelised cost followed a negative logarithmic trend while the internal rate of return followed a positive logarithmic trend as a function of the size of the community.

Firstly, with the adaptive law based on the feedback of battery SOC, the equivalence factor is described as a combination of the major component and tuning component. In particular, the major part defined as a constant is applied to the inherent consistency of regular speeding profiles, while the second part including a proportional and integral term can slightly tune the equivalence factor to satisfy the disparity of daily running cycles. Moreover, Pontryagin's Minimum Principle is employed and solved by using the shooting method to capture the co-state dynamics, in which the Secant method is introduced to adjust the initial co-state value.

A post-intervention survey (N = 233) indicated that showing occupants any thermal image (tailored or non-tailored) led to higher vividness when recalling the communication, compared to text-only information. Householders engaged with the reports to a greater extent when they were personal to their home: the tailored thermal images were more likely to be shared with others and led to stronger energy saving intentions and reporting energy efficiency behaviour compared to non-tailored reports. This is a promising approach integrating technology and social science knowledge and methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The findings show a staff sample with positive beliefs towards energy saving, but bounded by low feelings of self-efficacy, weak social norms, and perceived barriers in the office. Feedback may have supported feelings of collective efficacy and encouraged staff to talk with colleagues about ways to save energy.

In turn, energy saving in a WPTN can be boosted by simply switching off the energy transmitter when the received energy is too weak for rectification. Therefore in this paper we propose, and experimentally evaluate, two ""green"" protocols for the control plane of static charger/mobile receiver WPTN aimed at optimizing the charger workflow to make the WPTN reduce idle time of transmitters. Those protocols are: ""beaconing,"" where receivers advertise their presence to the WPTN, and ""probing"" exploiting the receiver feedback from the WPTN on the level of received energy. We demonstrate that both protocols reduce the unnecessary WPTN uptime, however trading it for the reduced energy provision, compared to the base case of ""WPTN charger always on.""

The parties involved in this study are a utility company, a distribution system operator and residential end-users. It allows the different participants to share a common electrical grid, without violating network constraints. A smart grid, equipped with a two-way communication system on a district level, is considered. For this purpose, each participant exchanges information, in order to establish a power consumption schedule that optimizes its own objectives, within the grid constraints. This strategy is illustrated on a district level to avoid overloading the distribution network. The consumption profiles of end-users consist of background consumption; some end-users are equipped with a heat pump and/or an electric vehicle, each of which is capable of responding to price variations. The impact of several tariff structures on the stability of the grid is explored. First of all, flat and day/night tariff structures are considered, and it is shown that price variation provokes load synchronization and leads to network overloads. Next, a real-time pricing tariff structure is used. If each end-user optimizes its behaviour to minimize personal costs, the grid is unable to supply all power during peak moments. In conclusion, if power constraints are imposed, the same grid can be stabilized, even if power demands increase by a factor of three or four. In a final example, the impact of imbalance costs is examined. The cluster can be guided to maximize profits for the utility company from the imbalance mechanism.

Energy conservation policies should encourage households to take measures that are actually effective in reducing energy consumption and that can be sustained over long periods of time. Few studies, however, have empirically examined what types of energy saving measures are actually effective and persistent. The electricity shortages following the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster provided an opportunity to examine this question. A web survey of households in Japan was implemented to obtain data on metered electricity use in the summers of 2010-2013, household behaviors for electricity savings, and household socioeconomic attributes. Regression analysis was conducted to explain the effectiveness and persistence of energy saving behaviors. Results indicate that most households took several electricity-saving measures after the disaster to adapt to the electricity shortage. Certain types of measures led to 2-4% savings in electricity consumption (per measure) and persisted for two years. The effective and persistent electricity-saving measures tended to be those that did not require either frequent efforts or considerable discomfort. Findings suggest that electricity-saving behaviors requiring infrequent effort and little discomfort can become engrained as new habits or lifestyles. In particular, one promising measure may be to lower the electricity-usage settings of appliances. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Demand-side management on a household level requires changes in the temporality of electricity-consuming practices in everyday life. One dominant approach to demand-side management is to influence the temporality of households' consumption patterns by providing economic incentives through variable electricity prices. This paper explores the temporal flexibility of Danish households' electricity consumption through their participation in two smart grid projects: One is offering households to test an electric vehicle during five months and another is offering static time-of-use pricing. Based on qualitative interviews and hourly-recorded electricity metering data with families living in single-family detached homes, the paper shows that the combined trial influenced the households to time shift consumption from high-tariff to low-tariff hours in relation to three consumption areas: dishwashing, laundering and charging of electric vehicles. The analysis goes beyond this apparent flexibility and explores how time shifting of energy demand challenges the temporality of households' routinised everyday practices. The study recommends that future smart grid interventions acknowledge the temporal complexity and dynamics of interwoven social practices and how this affects the potential for time shifting energy demand.

Due to increase in the demand and electricity price because of the added PEV load, a fixed point iteration method is applied to find new equilibrium load and price trajectories. By comparing the real electricity price and that resulted from the fixed point iteration, we can observe the impact of the PEVs on the power grid. In order to establish a realistic estimation pertaining to the PEV energy consumption and charging requirements, we use data from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) to generate a set of driving profiles. Moreover, we use the California ISO's historical electricity price and load data to develop a simplified electricity price model, as well as the California historical VMT data to calculate seasonality factors. Simulation results indicate that the PEVs in large numbers can help shave the demand peak and fill the demand valley, thereby flattening the grid demand profile. Moreover, we observe that California power grid is capable of accommodating a large PEV fleet without requiring a major upgrade to the existing electricity infrastructure, provided that optimal charge scheduling and bidirectional V2G interaction are enabled for the PEVs. © 2017 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).",,,False,,,809554,,2018-06-19 16:23:52.654269+00:00,0,False,,,Analyzing the impacts of Plug-in EVs on the California power grid using quadratic programming and fixed-point iteration,False,,,False,

Battery as a storage medium can take advantage of the price arbitrage between peak and off-peak period under favourable conditions. To investigate the impact of different pricing regimes, summer rate was implemented, and the results were compared with that of winter rate on yearly basis. At base case conditions, neither a prevailing summer nor winter pricing tariff favours the use of battery energy storage. A 0.4656 R/kWh price differential between peak and off-peak period for a summer pricing regime was not sufficient for the battery energy storage system to break even. Implementing a year-round winter pricing regime with a price differential of 2.1171 R/kWh between peak and off-peak period requires a minimum of 866 battery cycle life to break even. Probabilistic analysis using Monte Carlo simulation indicated that to make battery energy storage system attractive, at least 110% increase in the peak price of electricity for summer is needed.

To prevent large-scale blackouts, the Japanese government requested companies and households to reduce electricity consumption in summer and winter. It is reported that the domestic electricity demand had a structural decrease because of the electricity conservation effect (ECE). However, quantitative analysis of the ECE is not sufficient, and especially time variation of the ECE remains unclear. Understanding the ECE is important because Japan’s NDC (nationally determined contribution) assumes the reduction of CO2 emissions through aggressive energy conservation. In this study, we develop a time series model of monthly electricity demand in Japan and estimate time variation of the ECE. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of electricity conservation on CO2 emissions from power plants. The dynamic linear model is used to separate the ECE from the effects of other irrelevant factors (e.g. air temperature, economic production, and electricity price). Our result clearly shows that consumers’ electricity conservation behavior after the earthquake was not temporary but became established as a habit. Between March 2011 and March 2016, the ECE on industrial electricity demand ranged from 3.9% to 5.4%, and the ECE on residential electricity demand ranged from 1.6% to 7.6%. The ECE on the total electricity demand was estimated at 3.2%–6.0%. We found a seasonal pattern that the residential ECE in summer is higher than that in winter. The emissions increase from the shutdown of nuclear power plants was mitigated by electricity conservation. The emissions reduction effect was estimated at 0.82 MtCO2–2.26 MtCO2 (−4.5% on average compared to the zero-ECE case). The time-varying ECE is necessary for predicting Japan’s electricity demand and CO2 emissions after the earthquake. © 2018 Honjo et al.

The concern of most researchers in this field is to further unearth the potential of smart grid in the direction of demand response (DR) through enhanced demand side management (DSM) centering on the behavior of the end-user.

Besides, to residential customers for DR implementation, maintaining a balance between energy consumption cost and users’ comfort satisfaction is a challenge. Hence, in this paper, a constrained Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based residential consumer-centric load-scheduling method is proposed. The method can be further featured with edge computing. In contrast with cloud computing, edge computing-a method of optimizing cloud computing technologies by driving computing capabilities at the IoT edge of the Internet as one of the emerging trends in engineering technology-addresses bandwidth-intensive contents and latency-sensitive applications required among sensors and central data centers through data analytics at or near the source of data.

One promising facility called fast charging reservation(FCR) system was recently proposed. It allows people to reserve fast chargers ahead of time. In this system, fast chargers are the most scarce resource instead of electricity. Thus how to allocate these charging points requires careful designing. A good allocation policy should 1) ensure charging points to be allocated to EV users who really value them, and 2) prevent users' private information, e.g., identity, personal agenda, residing area and etc., from being inferred. A simple combination of classic multi-item auction and user identity anonymization cannot satisfy both criteria simultaneously. To find such an allocation, in this paper we investigate the design of privacy-preserving auctions in FCR systems. Traditional privacy-preserving strategies such as cryptography could incur high computation and communication overhead and hence jeopardize the efficiency of allocation. To this end, we propose Auc2Reserve, a differentially private randomized auction. Auc2Reserve applies an improved approximate sampler and the belief propagation (BP) technique to accelerate the resource allocation and pricing process. As a result, it is much more computationally efficient than generic exponential differentially private mechanisms and other theoretical approximate implementations. Through theoretical analysis, we show that Auc2Reserve is ?-incentive compatible, individual rational and ?-differentially private.

We show that such undesirable behavior is in fact systemic.

As the demand is never correctly predicted, the volume traded through the balancing markets increases, leading to higher overall costs. In this case, the system can sustain, and even benefit from, a small number of flexible users, but this solution can never upscale without increasing the total costs.

Analysis of several unsuccessful test cases revealed that customers are not willing to alter their consumption habits and reduce their comfort by responding to price signals, unless they are presented with tangible benefits (cost reduction, better energy services, etc.).

In this paper, we propose a real-time electricity marketing mechanism for the autonomous micro-grids. Our model is designed to meet the local energy demands while being self-sufficient and achieving high social satisfaction level of its associated producer/consumers (prosumers). To achieve this goal, in our proposed mechanism, the prosumers are clustered and represented by one high-level representative that is called the aggregator. Each aggregator is responsible to participate in the real-time market and make the decision on energy trading to meet the local power consumption demands, maintain the local financial stability, and maximize the satisfaction level of its associated prosumers. Our proposed marketing mechanism leverages a variation of the El-Farol bar problem to model the strategy of the aggregators. Furthermore, to evaluate the satisfaction of the prosumers toward the policy of the local electricity marketing, our proposed mechanism also defines and implements a social sensing model. In our simulations, we evaluate the performance of our electricity marketing mechanism by using a microgrid consisting of eight clusters of prosumers. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of our mechanism in achieving self-sufficiency and relative optimality in terms of load shedding and cumulative financial profit and residential customers' satisfaction. © 2017 IEEE.",,,False,,,809631,,2018-07-06 18:45:50.785415+00:00,0,False,,,A decentralized real-time electricity market mechanism for autonomous microgrids,False,,,False,

The study has been carried on nearly 27,000 residential consumers from Sangli city, Maharashtra State, India. Findings: These tariff plans are proposed with two objectives: first, possibility to shift consumer’s from existing to lower tariff plan for saving electricity and, second, to increase revenue by increasing tariff charges using Pay-by-Use policy. Research limitations/implications: The study can be performed on hourly or daily data using automatic meter reading and to introduce Time of Use or demand based tariff. Practical implications: The proposed study focuses on use of data mining techniques for tariff planning based on consumer’s electricity usage pattern. It will be helpful to detect abnormalities in consumption pattern as well as forecasting electricity usage. Social implications: Consumers will be able to decide own monthly electricity consumption and related tariff leading to electricity savings, as well as high electricity consumption consumers have to pay more tariff charges for extra electricity usage.

In particular, the problem of whether to expand the electricity power stations and distribution facilities due to the construction of EV charging stations is emerging as an immediate issue. To effectively meet the demand for additional electricity while ensuring the stability of the power grid, there is a need to accurately predict the charging demands for EVs. Therefore, this study estimates the changes in electricity charging demand based on consumer preferences for EVs, charging time of day, and types of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) and elucidates the matters to be considered for constructing EV infrastructure. The results show that consumers mainly preferred charging during the evening. However, when we considered different types of EVSEs (public and private) in the analysis, people preferred to charge at public EVSEs during the day. During peak load time, people tended to prefer charging using fast public EVSEs, which shows that consumers considered the tradeoffs between the full charge time and the price for charging.

As a result, the wind power producer benefits from fewer penalties caused by less deviation between real-time traded quantity and pre-offered one. The electricity consumer, on the other hand, benefits from a decreased electricity bills without reducing its satisfaction.

In an effort to reduce peak electricity demands, electricity market analysts and researchers have designed different pricing schemes that provide a certain incentive to end-users to reduce their usage during what is considered as peak hours. Among those schemes, Time of Use (ToU) and Real Time Pricing (RTP) have been well researched and implemented. However, it became noteworthy that the incentive provided by both schemes to customers is weak. In addition, it has been reported that they can even lead to peak migration instead of reduction. Recently, we introduced a new incentive-driven scheme named Minimax with the aim to incentivize customers to flatten their daily load profiles and help lower the aggregate peak power demands. Simulation studies showed that customers can save 13-17% of their electricity bills if the Minimax scheme is used but only 2-3% if RTP or ToU scheme is used. In addition, Minimax can save 10% of the generation cost. The benefit of Minimax is threefold: consumer bill reduction, peak power reduction, and generation cost reduction.

Storage is different from the conventional generators that have traditionally balanced supply and demand on fast time scales due to its hard energy capacity constraints, dynamic coupling, and low marginal costs. These differences are leading system operators to propose new mechanisms for enabling storage to participate in reserve and real-time energy markets. The persistence of market power and gaming in electricity markets suggests that these changes will expose new vulnerabilities. We develop a new model of strategic behavior among storages in energy balancing markets. Our model is a two-stage game that generalizes a classic model of capacity followed by Bertrand–Edgeworth price competition by explicitly modeling storage dynamics and uncertainty in the pricing stage. By applying the model to balancing markets with storage, we are able to compare capacity and energy-based pricing schemes and to analyze the dynamic effects of the market horizon and energy losses due to leakage.

As a result of this development, global installed capacity of wind power has expanded significantly. To make efficient use of onsite wind power generation facilities in manufacturing, production scheduling tools need to consider the uncertainty attached to wind power generation along with changes in the energy procurement cost and in the products’ environmental footprints. To this end, we propose a solution procedure that first generates a large number of wind power scenarios that characterise the variability in wind power over time. Subsequently, a two-stage stochastic optimisation procedure computes a production schedule and energy supply decisions for a flow shop system. In the first stage, a bi-objective mixed integer linear programme simultaneously minimises the total weighted flow time and the expected energy cost, based on the generated wind power scenarios. In the second stage, energy supply decisions are adjusted based on real-time wind power data.

This paper studies the optimal management of storage and electric vehicles at a household level when subject to financial constraints. A model using a real-time pricing structure is used to minimise the final consumer cost, whilst responding to power consumption limits set by the supplier. Implementation of the limits and pricing structure allow the supplier to better balance changes and discrepancies in both demand values and generation values. Using real data, models for solar generation, household load demand, and the pricing structure are proposed and integrated into the overall model for the household system. The model for the household system optimises the power taken from the grid and the power stored for the lowest end cost to the user. A series of laboratory evaluations are run to compare the effects of the electric vehicle, solar generation and limits on the household, and considerations are made to the financial and practical implications of these effects.

The results show that the heat consumption of the building is 120 kWh/m2/y during the heating season, and the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) of the GSHP, ASHP and WHGB systems are 3.27, 2.30, 0.88 respectively.

In this study customer responses to these more complex price models have been investigated through focus group interviews and through interviews with companies that have changed their price models. The results show that several important customer requirements are suffering with the new price models.

For this study, we surveyed consumer propensity to leave the home under CPP schemes and analyzed the impact of CPP on consumer cost. The results indicated that higher prices induce a higher rate of going out, while residential conditions such as population density and access to public transportation have a relatively small impact on leaving the home and average energy conservation. However, this is not always the case for aged households with limited mobility; residential conditions have a substantial effect on this segment of the population. Combined with a reduced ability to go out, electricity pricing has a greater negative impact on aged people.

Consequently, the undesirable large gaps between peak and off-peak loads will adversely affect the system’s efficiency due to unused capacity during off-peak hours and extra ancillary generators required during peak hours. Demand response (DR) has long been proposed to reduce peak load by providing incentives to encourage consumers to shift their peak loads to off-peak periods. In most DR literature, incentive schemes are purely financial in assuming that cost is the only parameter to influence consumers’ load-shifting behavior. In this paper, we assume that in addition to cost, convenience of energy usage is also an important factor when consumers respond to DR programs. Hence, we use multi-attribute utility functions consisting of both cost and convenience factors to model consumer behavior on energy consumption for home appliances. The “convenience” herein is defined as being able to use an appliance during one’s preferred time window. A simulation model is developed to study a residential population consisting of heterogeneous households with varying preference of convenience over cost.

This multi-year project is a first attempt to coordinate demand response request from the DSO (Distribution System Operator) or the TSO (Transmission System Operator) through the use of a local market that acts as a facilitator between infrastructure operators and commercial aggregators of energy resources. As solar electricity production is becoming more and more present in the energy mix, it also represents an important step towards the management of power production from equipment connected to the distribution grid. These new types of production are currently causing abnormal events like voltage spikes, protection openings or negative energy prices resulting from the energy not being absorbed by local loads.

Although many researchers have evaluated HEMS, no one has conducted a study which considers the control of various types of residential energy equipment in real time along with the uncertainties of energy demands. This paper proposes a single HEMS method which connects prediction, operational planning and control steps and enables the evaluation of operational planning methods of HEMS connected with many kinds of residential energy equipment currently in use in Japan while considering the uncertainties. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the economic potential of residential energy systems based on the proposed method with the uncertainties of energy demands and photovoltaic (PV) output under time-of-use prices. The results allowed us to establish a framework to quantitatively evaluate the operational planning methods of HEMS with the uncertainties of energy demands and PV output.

The situation is posed as a stochastic programming problem where the user chooses the optimal consumption profile to maximize his economic benefits. The consumer preferences are modeled as a risk-averse function under additive uncertainty. The case considered uses the previous consumption as the household-specific baseline for PTR program. As result, a rational user alters the baseline in order to increase his well-being.

In Study 2 we had users build their own mock energy displays. We learned that users want content that is easy to grasp quickly and do not want to spend time reading text or interpreting graphs. Affordability. In Study 3 we conducted three focus groups and found that users think HEDs are too expensive. There is a significant gap between how much people are willing to pay and how much even basic models cost.We further found that the design of energy feedback influences the user experience of HEM/HED devices. Users generally interpreted flexible, multimedia feedback as being easier to use and perceived aesthetically pleasing information as being easy to understand. Our Phase II goal was to recruit a set of 150 households and manipulate the level of user engagement with energy feedback. One group of participants received only a stand-alone HED; another group also received a supplemental Web portal. One of the main challenges in reaching our target sample size was to reconcile the need for an opt-out study design with the networking needs of the devices. This challenge required us to have access to the tenants' Internet connections, raising privacy and ethical concerns from property management. After extensive outreach campaigns in two buildings, only 8% of the buildings' tenant populations opted in to the HED study. We were unable to evaluate how effective HEDs are in maintaining energy saving behaviors, or if interaction with supplemental feedback methods would be more effective than a HED device alone. For our pilot deployment, we conducted extensive lab and field testing of The Energy Detective (TED), a leading HED model on the market. We encountered several problems, including parts that were unconfigured, gateway miscommunications, failure to post to a data- hosting third party, beta firmware upgrades, and display malfunctions. We concluded that large- scale deployment and maintenance of TED was unmanageable for our research team and moved forward with alternative technical solutions. Our findings highlight two general issues involved in technology deployment research. First, opt- in versus opt-out study design plays a significant role in the quality of a user sample. Early adopters permeate the current HEM market and research. This self-selection of samples raises concern for drawing conclusions across populations for energy savings based on other opt-in studies. Second, even with a detailed test plan, unexpected factors always arise. Study designs need to be flexible to accommodate restrictions of property management partners while maintaining research integrity. In light of these challenges, we continue to pursue a modified study at Harvard University, where we are currently investigating the effect of Web versus alert-based energy feedback in lieu of a physical display. Actively reminding participants with alerts can often minimize user effort and engage users meaningfully at critical time junctures.We recommend that an initiative using HEDs as problem-solving tools could be the most effective use of these products. For example, utility-based rental programs could allow consumers temporary use of an HED to raise awareness of their own household consumption patterns. As an alternative, product refinement in conjunction with a shift to smart metering infrastructure could make the next generation of HEDs much more sophisticated and useful for consumers. Finally, more research is needed to understand the capacity of feedback to increase the motivation of home occupants for saving energy. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

These fluctuations can be faced with flexible consumption through Demand Side Management (DSM), establishment of further centralized storage capacities and provisioning of dynamic back up generation capacities. At least, the latter two options can impose large establishment and operation costs upon the electricity market. Therefore, the feasibility and the resulting potential of coupling the electricity grid with the thermal supply of residential buildings is analysed in this paper. Thereby, inexpensive and widespread thermal storage capacities could be used to improve the integration of dynamic renewable electricity generation. In this paper the technical and economical key impact factors for such thermal DSM approach are elaborated. Based on a literature review, the identified key factors are aggregated to form consistent scenarios of the German ""Energiewende"" (turnaround in energy policy). The practicability and possible magnitude of the intended DSM is then analysed based on the identified scenarios. All resulting scenarios highlight the growing demand for a flexible electricity market. Especially in scenarios with strong growth of renewable electricity generation, up to 45 GW of flexible electric capacities would be required in Germany by the year 2030. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that independently of the energy market development, it is very likely that electricity coupled supply systems will continuously have installed capacities of at least 14 GW. It is found, that especially the strong dissemination of smart metering and smart control infrastructure is crucial to incorporate these capacities into DSM activities.

Retailers are incorporated to the smart grid with distributed control mechanism in order to reduce the amount of communication overhead associated with the direction interaction between utility companies and consumers. The retailer procures electricity from both traditional and renewable energy sources, and sells it to its consumers. The consumers include residential users that can only consume power, and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) that can either consume power or supply power stored in its battery to the grid. In this work, a novel four-stage nested game model is proposed to model the interaction of the electricity retailer, utility companies, and consumers. The objective of the retailer is to maximize its overall profit as well as perform frequency regulation, whereas the goal of each consumer is to maximize a predefined utility function. In the game theoretic framework, the retailer should decide the amounts of electricity purchased from the renewable and traditional energy sources, respectively, as well as the real-time pricing scheme for its consumers. The consumers will react to the pricing mechanism and maximize their utility functions by adjusting the electricity demand.

Such systems allow for the shifting of the starting time of deferrable devices according to the current energy price or power grid condition, in order to reduce the individual monthly bill or to adjust the power load experienced by the grid while meeting the users' preferences about the time of use. The drawback of DSM distributed protocols is that they require each user to communicate his/her own energy consumption patterns to the other users, which may leak sensitive information regarding private habits. This paper proposes a distributed Privacy-Friendly DSM system which preserves users' privacy by integrating data aggregation and perturbation techniques: users decide their schedule according to aggregated consumption measurements perturbed by means of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). We evaluate the noise power and the size of the set of users required to achieve a given privacy level, quantified by means of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The performance of our proposed DSM system are compared to the ones obtained by a benchmark system which does not support privacy preservation in terms of social cost, peak demand and convergence time.

Now, however, the network is seen as much more capable and reliable. Data are routinely transferred with high efficiency and low latency to wherever computing or storage resources are available to use or manage them. Although there was sufficient network bandwidth for the experiments' needs during Run-1, they cannot rely on ever-increasing bandwidth as a solution to their data-transfer needs in the future. Sooner or later they need to consider the network as a finite resource that they interact with to manage their traffic, in much the same way as they manage their use of disk and CPU resources. There are several possible ways for the experiments to integrate management of the network in their software stacks, such as the use of virtual circuits with hard bandwidth guarantees or soft real-time flow-control, with somewhat less firm guarantees. Abstractly, these can all be considered as the users (the experiments, or groups of users within the experiment) expressing a request for a given bandwidth between two points for a given duration of time. The network fabric then grants some allocation to each user, dependent on the sum of all requests and the sum of available resources, and attempts to ensure the requirements are met (either deterministically or statistically). An unresolved question at this time is how to convert the users' requests into an allocation. Simply put, how do we decide what fraction of a network's bandwidth to allocate to each user when the sum of requests exceeds the available bandwidth? The usual problems of any resourcescheduling system arise here, namely how to ensure the resource is used efficiently and fairly, while still satisfying the needs of the users. Simply fixing quotas on network paths for each user is likely to lead to inefficient use of the network. If one user cannot use their quota for some reason, that bandwidth is lost. Likewise, there is no incentive for the user to be efficient within their quota, they have nothing to gain by using less than their allocation. As with CPU farms, some sort of dynamic allocation is more likely to be useful. A promising approach for sharing bandwidth at LHCONE is the 'Progressive Second-Price auction', where users are given a budget and are required to bid from that budget for the specific resources they want to reserve. The auction allows users to effectively determine among themselves the degree of sharing they are willing to accept based on the priorities of their traffic and their global share, as represented by their total budget. The network then implements those allocations using whatever mix of technologies is appropriate or available. This paper describes how the Progressive Second-Price auction works and how it can be applied to LHCONE. Practical questions are addressed, such as how are budgets set, what strategy should users use to manage their budget, how and how often should the auction be run, and how do we ensure that the goals of fairness and efficiency are met.",,,False,,,810145,,2018-06-15 08:44:31.368598+00:00,0,False,,,"Bandwidth-sharing in LHCONE, an analysis of the problem",False,,,False,

The gap between the increasing computational complexity and the consumed energy can only be bridged by using more tailored computation engines, like dedicated hardware accelerators or application specific instruction set processors (ASIPs).

It refers to the active participation of households and small commercial consumers in energy systems by means of the flexibility they can offer. Upon receiving real-time price/volume signals, consumers may find convenient to change their load profiles in return of a monetary reward. In this way, they can contribute to the provision of services to the different participants in the electricity system. Since AD causes modifications of the typical consumers' behaviour, classical load forecasting tools not considering AD signals as inputs are expected to give inaccurate results when applied to load time series including AD effects. In this paper, we study this problem by comparing the prediction performances of several linear models of the load exploiting or not AD signals as inputs. The comparison shows that enhanced prediction results can be obtained by suitably combining the use of AD inputs and the extraction of seasonal characteristics. This is demonstrated by applying the considered approaches to simulated AD effects added to real measurements, representing the aggregated load of about 60 consumers from an Italian LV network. © 2012 IEEE.",,,False,,,810231,,2018-06-26 12:49:41.997642+00:00,0,False,,,Electric load forecasting in the presence of Active Demand,False,,,False,

To date, there are several case studies of demand management and control projects from around the world. To achieve results with sufficient generality, case studies need to be conducted over long periods, with a reasonable number of diverse households. Such case studies require large capital to set up hardware and software. To bypass these financial and temporal investments, we have designed a simulator for energy suppliers to use in order to learn the likely performance of large-scale deployments. Of main interest is the prediction of not only the level and firmness of demand response in critical peak pricing trials, but also the household's comfortable level and satisfaction level. As an example of the power of the simulator we have used it to develop and test a new self-adaptive methodology to intelligently control the energy demand. The methodology is adaptive to global factors, such as the market energy price, as well as local conditions, such as the satisfaction level of households. This paper outlines self-adaptive methodologies used within the simulator. Experimental results show energy consumption under different control strategies and the improvement of system behaviour through adaptive design. With the self-adaptive demand management strategy, the total energy consumed by one million households' controllable loads has reduced dramatically while the satisfaction level of households is well maintained.

These data are used for monitoring and analyzing consumed energy on device level in near real-time. Further, transparent information about the energy usage can be used to efficiently program and control home appliances depending on various factors, e.g. the electricity price. Making more and more data available to end-users, brings with it further challenges in the area of user interfaces. Hence, we complete the smart home system by intuitive user interfaces presenting energy consumption data in meaningful contexts and allowing end users to interact with their environment.

It also examines manufacturer claims of 80 percent plus electricity savings with these systems by reviewing a utility’s evaluation installation of one such product in its own office building, in comparison to three other typical office lighting systems. The utility’s case study confirms the impressive savings. Combining information technology with fixture-integrated controls, office lighting fixtures can now be controlled individually, in groups, or as an entire building-wide system through the local-area network (LAN). This new approach to office lighting is rapidly gaining acceptance throughout the retrofit and new-construction markets. Given the prospect of more than 80 percent savings on what can represent one-third of a building’s electricity usage, addressable lighting controls hold the potential of delivering impressive reductions in electricity usage. With addressable lighting, individual workers can adjust the light levels in their own work areas through software that directs messages to specific light fixtures. Energy managers can enable, reconfigure, and even schedule control settings for selected occupancy and daylight sensors—all from a personal computer. To address the growing concerns about available electricity supplies, load-shedding can be implemented on a system-wide basis for a gradual reduction in power levels during periods of peak demand or expensive real-time energy prices. Given the advances in information technology in recent decades, controls for office lighting have now emerged as easy-to-use, effective tools to assist energy managers in reaching today’s mandated goals for energy efficiency. © 2003 Energy Engineering.

Only average energy prices have been used in past analyses. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) presents a method that estimates marginal energy prices for residential electricity and natural gas. The method calculates the regression line relating monthly energy costs and consumption for electricity and natural gas using billing data from Energy Information Administration's (EIA) 1997 Residential Energy Conservation Survey (RECS). The slope of the regression line for each household is an estimate of that household's marginal price, for the season covered by the billing data. National mean marginal electricity prices are 2.5% less than average electricity prices in the summer and 10.0% less than average in the non-summer months. For natural gas, marginal prices are 4.4% less than average prices in the winter and 15.3% less than average prices in the non-winter months.

Operators in Canada's Province of Ontario face at least seven challenges, all in an environment of extreme cost awareness: 1. Natural gas and heating oil prices are rising steeply, and there is a strong expectation that electricity prices in Ontario will soon rise steeply and be subject to time-of-day pricing. 2. To save construction costs, much of the social housing stock was built with electric heating. 3. Also to reduce construction costs, much social housing was built to minimum acceptable standards, with inflexible mechanical systems and limited insulation. 4. Few social housing units have individual metering for electricity and other fuels. 5. Social housing developments are municipally or cooperatively owned. Both types have residents receiving rent subsidies; the latter type also has residents paying market 'rents' who function to a degree in a rental market. 6. Rent subsidies are in effect of two kinds: direct rent subsidies geared to household incomes, and social assistance (welfare) payments that include a rent component. A social housing tenant may benefit from one or both kinds of subsidy. Each kind is subject to a set of rules that allow little flexibility in charging for delivered energy. 7. There are few good data on most of the above matters that could help social housing operators respond to new energy pricing regimes. For the most part, social housing tenants are not exposed to energy costs and have little incentive to reduce energy consumption. Time-of-day electricity pricing will exacerbate this problem. There could be as much as a 12-fold difference in the variable component of the electricity charge between the highest and the lowest prices that are charged, but with little to encourage tenants to change their behaviour so as to avoid building operators incurring the highest charges.

These sample households were spread over three temperature zones and five consumption levels, and faced two definitions of the peak (off-peak) period and four peak/off-peak price ratios. To supply a reference case for subsequent comparisons to SCE’s current domestic rate, a statistical control group of 120 customers facing standard rates was also selected. The two main rate groups in the experiment, Rate A, whose peak period definition is 10 a.m.-8 p.m. PST nonholiday weekdays, and Rate B, whose peak period definition is 8 p.m.-10 p.m. PST nonholiday weekdays, are always treated separately. In this article we use the 18 months of data on peak period, off-peak period (including weekends), and total consumption spanning May 1979-October 1980, thereby encompassing two complete summers and one complete winter. We pool the monthly data in seasonal ANCOVA models but allow the months to have separate additive influences. Weather effects are accounted for explicitly. We conclude that there are significant conservation effects in the peak period as a result of TOU pricing. This result holds for the overall sample and in particular for high consumption groups (410-740 kWh/mo.) and (>740 kWh/mo.). Some shifting of usage to the off-peak period does take place, but frequently this amount does not equal the peak period reduction, and hence overall conservation takes place. This conservation effect, when observed, is limited to roughly 5% in the overall sample, while in some cases peak period reductions in the summer range up to 19.2%. Increased interest in “direct” load management techniques such as remote air conditioner cycling and demand subscription service led us also to address the question of the impact of TOU pricing on system peak days. If customers choose to ignore even significant peak/off-peak price differentials on system peak days? though they may be few in number, the hoped for capacity savings from peak-load pricing may not materialize. The main findings are that contrary to the skepticism often expressed, TOU customers behave in a similar fashion on system peak days and on average summer weekdays. Indeed, there are several instances of even higher relative peak period savings on system peak days. © Journal of Business and Economic Statistics.",,,False,,,810431,,2018-06-26 12:51:22.850312+00:00,1,False,,,Measuring peak load pricing response from experimental data: An exploratory analysis,False,,,False,

In particular, we show that the uncompensated own-price elasticities must be smaller than the negative of the expenditure shares; that is, the price elasticity of peak electricity demand must be less than the negative of the share of expenditure devoted to peak electricity. This finding is probably not new to economists familiar with consumer demand analysis. Nevertheless, many recent studies of consumer demand for electricity under time-of- day rates explicitly impose this restriction. The resulting price elasticity estimates are usually quite large in absolute value (.5 to.8); but they are the product of restrictive a priori assumptions as well as information embodied in the sample data. The results of two analyses of time-of-day experiments, where the researchers imposed the untested assumption of homothetic separability, are examined more closely.

The optimization technique was used to set the criteria for all the above-grade and below-grade envelope components. The basis for the optimization is incremental life-cycle cost (LCC) analysis. The analysis begins with an uninsulated envelope component as the base case. For example, the base case for an above-grade frame wall has no cavity insulation and no sheathing. Next, typical wall constructions are defined using various levels of cavity insulation and sheathing combinations. These walls are ranked in order of decreasing U-values. Installed costs to the consumer were assembled for each wall construction. The optimization procedure compares two cases on an incremental basis. It starts with the base case and determines the incremental energy savings relative to the next construction option that has a lower U-value. These energy savings are then converted into seasonal operating cost savings using average national fuel prices. Separate calculations are completed for heating and cooling. The results of the optimization consist of heating degree-days to base 65°F (HDD65) and cooling degree-hours to base 74°F (CDH74), which are required for the specific construction to satisfy the LCC criteria. The optimization procedure is repeatedly applied in sets. The first set of calculations compares all the construction options to the uninsulated case. The upgrade from the first analysis becomes the base case for the second set of comparisons. Using this new base case, all the remaining constructions are evaluated again. This process of redefining a new base case and calculating the incremental performance is repeated until all but the lowest U-value construction has been used as a base case. The results of all the calculations are presented as a two-dimensional matrix. The criteria for the standard are then easily determined by inspection from the matrix. Starting with the uninsulated wall as the base case, one simply identifies which wall construction has the lowest HDD65 and CDH74 requirements. This wall becomes the criterion. Once this wall is identified, it is used as the new base case. This process is repeated until HDD65 exceeds the climate range for the U.S. The most important feature of this technique is that it provides a consistent procedure that can be applied to all the envelope components. It logically assesses all combinations and selects the optimum that satisfies the LCC criteria.

Biochips based on nanocluster-enhanced absorption were developed as a new technology for gaining complex bioanalytical information for use in Genomics, Proteomics and clinical diagnostics. The choice of metal clusters as signal transducers of molecular binding events is based on their strong local field enhancement compared to the non-focused light field. By using cluster based assays it is possible to visualize the binding of biomolecules at a given surface by a bound layer of fluorescent molecules near to a layer of metal clusters. The success of SEF is based on the significant signal increase compared to standard glass slide DNA and protein assays. Cluster probes are not only efficient enhancers but also direct markers, which became the basis of new devices employing cluster resonance and cluster-cluster interactions. Multi-layered highly resonant cluster assemblies clearly exhibit strong resonant behavior of the metal cluster layer. These narrow absorbance peaks enable the efficient coupling of energy to the metal nano-cluster within its field enhancement range. Chips were read out using a commercial 2-wavelength laser based chip optical scanner with 5 μm resolution obtaining 60-140 MB of scanning data within a few minutes.

The criteria seek to avoid price discrimination among customers in the same class, assure adequate revenue to the utility, prevent one class of customers from subsidizing another class, maintain coverage of the utility's fixed costs, and avoid premature capacity additions. As pricing innovations continue in the future, economic efficiency is not the sole objective of utility pricing, equity also is an important objective that must be served. -from Authors",,,False,,,810479,,2018-06-26 12:52:15.077069+00:00,0,False,,,"Innovation, regulation in electric ratemaking",False,,,False,

Rapid growth in residential AC ownership threatens to undermine national energy efficiency and greenhouse reduction targets. Furthermore residential AC is placing a strain on the national electricity system, especially during heat waves when electricity demand peaks. These AC-driven peak loads occur just occasionally each summer, and so increasing grid capacity to meet them represents a grossly inefficient use of capital. For example, at present 10% of New South Wales' generating capacity is needed for just 1 per cent of the time (less than 100 hours a year), and if residential AC penetration increases as expected, this will rise to 20% of generating capacity for use just 1% of the time by 2014. The alternative to continually expanding grid capacity to supply an ever increasing residential AC peak demand is to focus on managing that demand. The Demand Response (DR) approach can be defined as a change in an electrical product's normal mode of operation in response to an initiating signal originating from a remote agent, usually with the objective of reducing the product's power demand at times of peak load. Two broad demand response strategies have emerged to date. The first is based on real-time pricing for electricity. During heat waves the kW cost is increased to a level that is supposed to dissuade enough householders from switching on their AC units that aggregate peak load is kept within manageable limits. This approach relies on a clear price signal (Variable Pricing Regime - VPR), possibly orders of magnitude higher at peak demand times, to influence behaviour, but it lacks the certainty or firmness of response necessary for effective network management. The alternative DR strategy sees the utility company directly cycling off-and-on for short periods the individual householders' AC compressor during critical peak demand periods (Direct Load Control - DLC). This deprives householders of total control of their AC unit at the very same time they want it most, and so it requires a financial incentive for householders to consider participating. Because the utility is in control of the load shedding, firmness of response is assured. Both CPP and DLC approaches reduce to thermal comfort problems. The first finds out how much people are prepared to pay to shift their thermal sensation down a notch-or-two on the seven-point rating scale during heat-wave episodes. The second approach requires the utility to estimate how long the householder's AC compressor can be switched off before the house heats up to uncomfortable and unacceptable levels.

992,1206,2007,2-s2.0-84882730226,,False,"Strong dependency on crude oil in most areas of modern transportation needs lead into a significant consumption of petroleum resources over many decades. In order to maximize the effective use of remaining resources, various types of powertrain topologies, such as hybrid configurations among fuel cell, electric battery as well as conventional IC engine, have been proposed and tested out for number of vehicle classes including a personal commuting vehicle. In this paper the vehicle parameters are based on a typical commercial sub-compact vehicle (FIAT Panda) and energy needs are estimated on the sized powertrain. The main control approach is divided in two categories: off-line global optimization with dynamic programming (DP, not implementable in real time), and on-line Proportional and Feed-Forward with PI controllers. The proposed control approaches are developed both for charge-sustaining and charge-depleting mode and sample results are shown and compared. The Plug-in FCHEV can draw electricity either from a power grid line or from a personal eco-system that is completely independent from the conventional power grid line. Especially in the latter case, a well designed hybrid wind/photovoltaic generating system may supply the powers to the user in a self-sustaining mode and possibly some extra powers especially during the nights. Under this scenario, a smart power management system supervises the energy flows and optimizes the charging schedule taking into account time variations of the demand and the time variation of energy prices as well as the conversion efficiency. Thus, the ultimate goal of minimizing the energy cost and the dependency on the grid can be achieved. As a proof of concept, although the vehicle is not the same class of the study, a commercial 3.5 kW neighborhood electric vehicle has been modified to become a Plug-in Hybrid FCNEV with an air-cooled PEMFC power system, NiMH battery modules and a bidirectional DC/DC converter.

993,1207,2007,2-s2.0-84890158454,,False,"Art 87 of the Treaty of Rome reads: ""Save as otherwise provided in this Treaty, any aid in any form whatsoever granted by a Member State or through State resources which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, insofar as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the common market."" The underlying purpose of a principal ban on State aid in Art 87 EC lies in guaranteeing fair competition, functioning markets and economic efficiency within the European Union. In the words of the Commission's recent State Aid Action Plan 2005 its competition policy ""rests upon the idea that a market-based economy provides the best guarantee for raising living conditions in the EU to the benefit of citizens.... Competition is furthermore essential to enhance the competitiveness of the European economy, as it creates an environment in which efficient and innovative companies are rewarded properly"".2 Against this background the Commission emphasizes that ""State aid control comes from the need to maintain a level playing field for all undertakings active in the Single European Market, no matter in which Member State they are established. There is a particular need to be concerned with those state aid measures, which provide unwarranted selective advantages to some firms, preventing or delaying the market forces from rewarding the most competitive firms, thereby decreasing overall European competitiveness. It may also lead to a build-up of market power in the hands of some firms, for instance when companies that do not receive state aid (e.g. non-domestic firms) have to cut down on their market presence, or where state aid is used to erect entry barriers. As a result of such distortions of competition, customers may be faced with higher prices, lower quality goods and less innovation"".3 Moreover state aid would ""not come for free"", as taxpayers in the end have to finance state aid and there are opportunity costs to it. Giving aid to undertakings would ""mean taking funding away from other policy areas"".4 Without questioning the reasonableness of these economic considerations of the Commission in principle, it must however be noted that it would be an illusion to think that the EC State Aid rules alone can ensure a ""level playing field"" on the European Market, as the EC State aid control has to start from an unequal general legal setting in the European Union. An illustrative example is the procedure against the Austrian Energy Tax Rebate system that was installed in Austria in package with the first introduction of a new energy tax.5 The rebate system was then attacked because it provided for a selective advantage for huge energy consumers that were granted a rebate of a certain percentage of their energy tax debt establishing a sort of ceiling of the maximum energy tax costs. To the Austrian industry the reproaches of being ""subsidized"" by the energy tax package came as an ""economic surprise"" since the introduction of the energy tax package meant a huge additional financial burden for them, while many other European Member States still did not have any energy taxation at all at this time. Therefore one should not forget: As the choice of tax events lies within the sovereignty of the Member States, the European State aid rules cannot do anything against such general differences between the Member States - a structural deficiency that has to be kept in mind when talking about the economic function of State aid control.6 As the wording of Art 87 EC already shows (arg ""any aid in any form whatsoever""), Art 87 EC is characterized by a very broad notion of State Aid7, also referred to as ""form neutrality"" of the EC State aid surveillance. This form neutrality has already been stressed by the Spaak Report preparing the draft of the EC Treaty in 19568 and shall prevent Member States from easily circumventing the prohibition by simply changing the form of their individual business support. As the Treaty of Rome does not contain any legal definition of the term ""aid"", its borderlines had to be determined by the ruling practice of the ECJ. According to the Court the term embraces every ""measure which, in various forms, reduces the charges normally borne by an undertaking and which is not therefore a subsidy in the strict sense of the word but is equivalent to one by reason of its nature and effect"". 9 This early ruling in the Case De Gezamenlijke Steenkolenijnen has remained the landmark decision in the definition of the scope of Art 87 EC and is thus still the starting point of any examination of indirect State aid including cases of preferential tax measures. Later rulings of the ECJ have further stressed the broad concept of Art 87 EC and its effect-orientated definition approach. On the occasion of the Case Italy v Commission of 1974, in which the ECJ had to examine a temporary and partial reduction of social charges for the benefit of the textile and garment-making industry and small craft, the Court held: ""The aim of Article 9210 is to prevent trade between Member States from being affected by benefits granted by the public authorities which, in various forms, distort or threaten to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods. Accordingly, Article 92 does not distinguish between the measures of State intervention concerned by reference to their causes or aims but defines them in relation to their effects. Consequently, the alleged fiscal nature or social aim of the measure in issue cannot suffice to shield it from the application of Article 92"".11 Tax privileges do not go hand in hand with direct funding, but they put the beneficiaries in a clearly better position than their competitors who pay the full amount of taxes and hereby fulfil the De Gezamenlijke-formula. Fiscal privileges could consist of ""a reduction in the tax base (such as special deductions, special or accelerated depreciation arrangements or the entering of reserves on the balance sheet); a total or partial reduction in the amount of tax (such as an exemption or a tax credit) or a deferment, cancellation or even special rescheduling of tax debt.""12 Due to the progressive element of direct taxation it is, however, typical for this form of aid that its exact amount cannot be fixed at a certain sum a priori. It varies case by case depending on the exact profit situation of the individual undertaking in the relevant fiscal year, which can logically just be determined a posteriori. In a loss situation it might even be nil.13 For enterprises this makes it often difficult to plan extra-investments on the mere grounds of tax advantages attainable. That's why economics rather prefer direct subsidies over tax reductions as means to reach important political goals.14 From an economic point of view another fundamental peculiarity of fiscal aid is that it is normally designed as so-called operating aid. This means that the aid measures ""are not linked to the carrying out of specific projects and reduce a firm's current expenditure without it being possible to assess the precise volume involved when the Commission carries out its ex ante examination"". 15 As such aid is not proportionate to and directly targeted to new investments, job creation or other Community objectives, the Commission is very reluctant to authorise it at all. If it does so, the aid must be degressive, limited in time and applied outside sensible sectors of disrupted competition. 16 If a Member State plans to introduce new State aid measures, it has to notify its plans to the Commission that can authorize these measures under a catalogue of reasons (Art 87 para 3 EC), if the proposed aid scheme has a beneficial impact ""in overall Union terms"". This possibility of being declared compatible with the Common Market has been included in the Treaty because State aid measures can - in the words of the Commission - ""sometimes be effective tools for achieving objectives of common interest. They can correct market failures, thereby improving the functioning of markets and enhancing European competitiveness. They can also help promote e.g. social and regional cohesion, sustainable development and cultural diversity, irrespective of the correction of market failures"".17 As the allegedly ""clearly defined""18 objectives of common interest in Art 87 para 3 EC are in fact not that clearly defined, but leave a huge room of discretion to the Commission, they have given the Commission a very strong political position in coshaping the Member States' economic policy.19 The rest of this chapter is organized in four main sections: Section 6.2 will shortly describe the evolvement of the EC State aid policy and the development of Art 87 EC into a sort of European Principle of Equality Test for national business legislation demonstrating that there are no areas of tax law spared from its grasp. In Sect. 6.3 I will elaborate on the specific procedural concept of the European State aid rules as failures to duly notify State aid measures have - despite the uncertainty of the material EC State aid test - far-reaching immediate consequences including possible recovery claims on the motion of competitors. In this context I will also demonstrate that many core procedural issues are still not settled by European case law. Sometimes undertakings therefore even ended up being given additional money when unlawful State aid was detected.20 The procedural uncertainties make it also difficult to assess the political dimension of the EC State aid rules comprehensively. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

Real-time feedback and appliance-level information is necessary, but most solutions require extensive hardware sub-metering, with a high price due to the hardware and installation costs.

In the proposed agent-based model, the main stakeholders are modelled by the software agents including Conventional Home Agents, Smart Home Agents, a Utility Agent, a Primary Plant Agent and Secondary Plant Agents. A mechanism of dynamic pricing is applied to both the Conventional Home Agent System (Scenario #1) and the Smart Home Agent System (Scenario #2). Comparing to the Scenario #1, the peak demand, average householder's bills and generation cost in the Scenario #2 is decreased by 24.6%, 7.4% and 14.7% respectively.

Along the way, a number of significant barriers were overcome. Specifically, the project involves a 37 building garden apartment complex covering over 60 acres in Queens, New York, where a project team of consultants and technology vendors integrated an advanced 2-way wireless data communications system, electrical submetering, a 3- period time-of-use rate, apartment temperature sensors, boiler control and room air conditioner controls. The installation addressed the unique barriers of garden apartment complexes by consolidating data from all 930 individual apartments and 33 utility master-meters. In addition, the apartment meters use a color-coded LED display to inform residents of the TOU price period, temperature sensors transmit information to the boiler control system and integrated controls enable control of room air conditioner units during hot summer days. Original projected reductions in apartment sector electric consumption and demand were 20% and in overall building heating fuel consumption at 10%. Actual results will be documented in this paper. Additional incentives are also anticipated from NYISO for demand response activities, such as critical day load curtailments. This NYSERDA project is serving as a model for integrating multiple energy and demand reduction measures in multifamily buildings, especially garden apartment complexes, which have entailed significant barriers to energy savings measures, particularly electrical submetering, in the past.

The panel data set is analyzed with a fixed effects regression model. The estimates indicate average demand reductions up to 0.37 kWh/h per household in response to the tariff. This is on average a 5% reduction, with a maximum reduction of 12% in hour 8 in Dec.

However, due to the strict government regulations on environmental protection, operation at minimum cost is no longer the only criterion for dispatching electrical power. The idea behind the environmentally constrained economic dispatch formulation is to estimate the optimal generation schedule of generating units in such a manner that fuel cost and harmful emission levels are both simultaneously minimized for a given load demand. Conventional optimization techniques become very time consuming and computationally extensive for such complex optimization tasks. These methods are hence not suitable for on-line use. Neural networks and fuzzy systems can be trained to generate accurate relations among variables in complex non-linear dynamical environment, as both are model-free estimators. The existing synergy between these two fields has been exploited in this paper for solving the economic and environmental dispatch problem on-line. A multi-output modified neo-fuzzy neuron (NFN), capable of real time training is proposed for economic and environmental power generation allocation. This model is found to achieve accurate results and the training is observed to be faster than other popular neural networks.

Methodology: We used secondary sources, performing a literature review, together with analysis and synthesis. Findings: Policy makers prefer to use tools offered by neoclassical economics, such as various forms of taxation, fines and financial incentives in order to make domestic electricity consumers save electricity, on the assumption that consumers will make rational decisions while maximizing their personal benefit. However, studies conducted in recent years in the field of behavioral economics, which are based on the assumption that consumers' decisions are not rational and are affected by cognitive biases, showed that the use of behavioral tools, such as detailed online information (feedback),social comparison information, information on varying rates (dynamic pricing) and general information (advertising campaign), are tools that are not less appropriate than the ones the neoclassical economics offers, mainly because electricity is an invisible product and consumers are unable to assess it by normal cognitive measures. Using an interdisciplinary combination of behavioral tools that come from a variety of approaches taken from a wide variety of different academic fields, it is possible to receive efficient results in the endeavor of reducing electricity demand. Implications: Although the neoclassical economics still remains the fundamental theory used by policymakers, it is recommended to consider behavioral economics as a complementary approach to the neoclassical economics, and combine behavioral tools in the policymakers ' toolbox, especially when those tools do not require a significant financial investment, thus efficiently maximizing the reduction of electricity demand among domestic consumers.

ToU prices reflect the actual electricity cost and the rate is commonly set base on market price of electricity. Implementing ToU pricing system on a regulated electricity system such as in Malaysia is complicated due to non existence of electricity market. The electrical utility company or the regulator will need to determine the optimum ToU prices that would give the correct price signal so that customers will react accordingly. Many factors need to be considered such as impact on electricity generation cost, load profile, load elasticity and customers’ satisfaction. This paper presents an optimization method to estimate the optimum ToU prices for given electricity demand profile and demand elasticity. The presented method able to reduce the gap between peak and off-peak demand and ensure the estimated ToU prices are fairly proportionate among hours i.e. summation of rate increments (from the fixed price) is equal to the summation of rate decrements.

Different from traditional rate structure, electricity price of smart grid is time varying and dependent on the total demand. The most common strategy for a factory to reduce electricity cost is to shift electricity usage from on-peak hours to off-peak hours. However, changes in manufacturing schedules affect power demand and electricity price. Moreover, a manufacturing process cannot be interrupted after being started. This dynamic coupling brings additional challenges to scheduling problem that is already NP-hard. In this paper, a time-indexed integer programming scheme is developed and implemented in General Algebraic Modeling System to solve the scheduling problem. To demonstrate the approach, a hypothetical region including power distribution/transmission system, residential/commercial buildings and a flow shop operating 8/16 working hours/day is considered. The operation of residential/commercial buildings is subject to time-of-use tariff and described in GridLAB-D.

For example, 'increased cocaine intake over time' has been modeled by providing long access (LgA) to cocaine during daily self-administration sessions under a fixed-ratio (FR1) reinforcement schedule. In addition, 'increased time and energy devoted to acquire cocaine' has been modeled by providing access to cocaine during daily self-administration sessions under a progressive-ratio (PR) schedule. To investigate the distinctiveness of these models, the behavioral economics variables of consumption and price were applied to cocaine self-administration data. To assess changes in consumption and price, cocaine self-administration was tested across a descending series of doses (0.237-0.001 mg per injection) under an FR1 reinforcement schedule to measure drug intake in the high dose range and thresholds in the low range. Cocaine consumption remained relatively stable across doses until a threshold was reached, at which maximal responding was observed. It was found that a history of LgA training produced an increase in cocaine consumption; whereas a history of PR training produced an increase in the maximal price (Pmax) expended for cocaine. Importantly, the concepts of consumption and price were found to be dissociable. That is, LgA training produced an increase in consumption but a decrease in Pmax, whereas PR training produced an increase in Pmax without increasing consumption. These results suggest that distinct aspects of the addiction process can be parsed using self-administration models, thereby facilitating the investigation of specific neurobiological adaptations that occur through the addiction process. © 2009 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.",,,False,,,810581,,2018-06-26 12:53:02.455788+00:00,0,False,,,Behavioral economic assessment of price and cocaine consumption following self-administration histories that produce escalation of either final ratios or intake,False,,,False,

To achieve a high level of reliability and robustness in power systems, the grid is usually designed for peak demand rather than for average demand. This usually results in an under-utilized system. To remedy this problem, different programs have been proposed to shape the daily energy consumption pattern of the users in order to reduce the peak-to-average ratio in load demand and use the available generating capacity more efficiently, avoiding the installation of new generation and transmission infrastructures. However, the increasing expectations of the customers both in quantity and quality [2], emerging new types of demand such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which can potentially double the average household energy consumption [3], the limited energy resources, and the lengthy and expensive process of exploiting new resources give rise to the need for developing some more advanced methods for DSM. Since electricity cannot be stored economically, wholesale prices (i.e., prices set by competing generators to regional electricity retailers) vary drastically between the low-demand times of day and the high-demand periods. However, these changes are usually hidden from retail users. That is, end users are usually charged with some average price. To alleviate this problem, various time-differentiated pricing methods have been proposed in the literature. Some examples include day-ahead pricing, time-of-use pricing, critical-peak-load pricing, and adaptive pricing [4–7]. By equipping users with two-way communication capabilities in smart grid systems and by adopting real-time pricing (RTP) methods, it is possible to reflect the fluctuations of wholesale prices to retail prices. © Cambridge University Press 2012.",,,False,,,810594,,2018-07-13 11:42:59.679163+00:00,0,False,,,Demand-side management for smart grid: Opportunities and challenges,False,,,False,

Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) are among those with the highest potential for DR. Some of the challenges in modelling TCLs is the various factors that affect their duty cycle, mainly human behaviour and external conditions, as well as heterogeneity of TCLs (load parameters). These add an element of stochasticity, with detrimental impact on the aggregated level. Most models developed so far use Wiener processes to represent this behaviour, which in aggregated models, such as those based on Coupled Fokker-Planck Equations (CFPE), have a negligible effect as “white noise”. One of the main challenges is modelling the effect of external factors on the state of TCLs’ aggregated population and their impact in heterogeneity during operation. Here we show the importance of those factors as well as their detrimental effect in heterogeneity using cold loads as a case study. A bottom up detailed model has been developed starting from thermal modelling to include these factors, real world data was used as input for realistic results. Based on those we found that the duty cycle of some TCLs in the population can change significantly and thus the state of the TCLs’ population as a whole. Subsequently, the accuracy of aggregation models assuming relative homogeneity and based on small stochasticity (i.e. Wiener process with typical variance 0.01) is questionable. We anticipate similar realistic models to be used for real world applications and aggregation methods based on them, especially for cold loads and similar TCLs, where external factors and heterogeneity in time are significant. DR control frameworks for TCLs should also be designed with that behaviour in mind and the developed bottom up model can be used to evaluate their accuracy. © 2018 The Authors",,,False,,,810642,,2018-06-19 12:36:25.338423+00:00,0,False,,,Human in the loop heterogeneous modelling of thermostatically controlled loads for demand side management studies,False,,,False,

During the network formation, the growth cones migrate through the embryonic environment to their targets using chemical communication. A major obstacle in the elucidation of fundamental principles underlying this self-wiring is the complexity of the system being analyzed. Hence much effort is devoted to in vitro experiments of simpler (two-dimensional) 2D model systems. In these experiments neurons are placed on Poly-L-Lysine (PLL) surfaces, so it is easier to monitor their self-wiring. We developed a model to reproduce the salient features of the 2D systems, inspired by the study of the growth of bacterial colonies and the aggregation of amoebae. We represent the neurons (each composed of cell's soma, neurites and growth cones) by active elements that capture the generic features of the real neurons. The model also incorporates stationary units representing the cells' soma and communicating walkers representing the growth cones. The stationary units send neurites one at a time, and respond to chemical signaling. The walkers migrate in response to chemotaxis substances emitted by the soma and communicate with each other and with the soma by means of chemotactic ""feedback"". The interplay between the chemo-repulsive and chemo-attractive responses is determined by the dynamics of the walker's internal energy which is controlled by the soma.

The charging of a single electric vehicle can draw several kilowatts of power, and the aggregate effects of charging thousands of electric vehicles on electric power system infrastructure, operation, and planning must be considered. An important tool in studying the integration of electric vehicles and developing associated technologies and controls within the framework of the smart grid are probabilistic models of charging station load. This article identifies, evaluates, and proposes probabilistic models and analyzes the statistical characteristics of aggregated electric vehicle charging station load.

GridLAB-D is an agent-based distribution system simulation environment that allows fine-grained end-user models, including geospatial and network topology detail. A problem exists in that, without outside intervention, once the GridLAB-D simulation begins execution, it will run to completion without allowing the real-time interaction of Smart Grid controls, such as home energy management systems and aggregator control. We address this lack of runtime interaction by designing a flexible communication interface, Bus.py (pronounced bus-dot-pie), that uses Python to pass messages between one or more GridLAB-D instances and a Smart Grid simulator. This work describes the design and implementation of Bus.py, discusses its usefulness in terms of some Smart Grid scenarios, and provides an example of an aggregator-based residential demand response system interacting with GridLAB-D through Bus.py. The small scale example demonstrates the validity of the interface and shows that an aggregator using said interface is able to control residential loads in GridLAB-D during runtime to cause a reduction in the peak load on the distribution system in (a) peak reduction and (b) time-of-use pricing cases. © 2015 IEEE.",,,False,,,810648,,2018-06-29 06:18:44.292702+00:00,0,False,,,Bus.py: A GridLAB-D communication interface for Smart distribution Grid simulations,False,,,False,

If, within a cell the ps is Jeans unstable, collapsing, and cooling rapidly, it is transformed to galaxy subunits, which are then followed with a collisionless code. These particles emit UV radiation and supernova blasts with energy efficiencies (in units of mc2) equal to (epsilon(UV), epsilon(SN)) = (10(-4), 10(-4.5)). This energy input significantly alters some aspects of the simulation; the primary consequences are to heat and ionize the ps at a much earlier epoch than if stellar feedback were ignored. We study two representative boxes with sizes L = (80, 8)h-1 Mpc, in both cases utilizing a 200(3) mesh containing 200(3) dark matter particles and having nominal resolutions of (400, 40)h-1 kpc, respectively, with true resolution approximately 2.5 times worse. We adopt the standard CDM perturbation spectrum with an amplitude Of sigma8 = (deltaM/M)rms,8 = 0.77, a compromise between the COBE normalization sigma8 = 1.05 and that indicated by the small-scale velocity dispersion (perhaps sigma8 = 0.45). We find that by the time that 0.2% of the baryons have been transformed to stars at redshift 8.6, reionization is 1/2 complete, and observed Gunn-Peterson limits to a redshift of z = 5 am satisfied. Very hot (10(7)-10(8) K) gas is produced by shocks in the clusters, lower temperature (10(6) K) ps from supernova-fed superwinds is in lower density filaments and sheets and photoheated ps (10(4)-10(5) K) fills the voids. The mass fractions in these components at redshift zero being roughly (29%, 40%, 31%) correspond to ps in the temperature ranges (< 10(5.5), 10(5.5)-10(6.5), > 10(6.5)) K. In rich clusters the galaxy and dark matter densities are more concentrated than the ps density in agreement with gravitational lens observations.

The effort was demonstrated in absolute terms (V'O2), in relation to the involved person's maximum physical capacity (peak V'O2) and in relation to the individual aerobic-anaerobic threshold (V'O2 at VT1, the point when lactate starts to accumulate but can be cleared). In addition to this, the aim was to verify the suitability of portable ergospirometry in determining the occupational workload in a real-life setting. Methods: Thirty-five cleaners performed a bicycle ergospirometry to determine their maximum physical capacity (peak V'O2 = L/min) and their aerobic-anaerobic threshold (V'O2 at the Ventilatory Threshold 1 [VT1]). This was followed by portable ergospirometry lasting 45-60 min while pursuing regular cleaning activities. Results: Performance V'O2 (the average oxygen consumption over 45-60 min of work-time) was 1.06 L/min or 4.4 METs. This was scarcely lower than the individual V'O2 at VT1 and approached 45% of the maximum physical capacity (peak V'O2). In addition, there was positive feedback regarding the wearability of the portable device. The dropout rate was low.

Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) are among those with the highest potential for DR. Some of the challenges in modelling TCLs is the various factors that affect their duty cycle, mainly human behaviour and external conditions, as well as heterogeneity of TCLs (load parameters). These add an element of stochasticity, with detrimental impact on the aggregated level. Most models developed so far use Wiener processes to represent this behaviour, which in aggregated models, such as those based on Coupled Fokker-Planck Equations (CFPE), have a negligible effect as ""white noise"". One of the main challenges is modelling the effect of external factors on the state of TCLs' aggregated population and their impact in heterogeneity during operation. Here we show the importance of those factors as well as their detrimental effect in heterogeneity using cold loads as a case study. A bottom up detailed model has been developed starting from thermal modelling to include these factors, real world data was used as input for realistic results. Based on those we found that the duty cycle of some TCLs in the population can change significantly and thus the state of the TCLs' population as a whole. Subsequently, the accuracy of aggregation models assuming relative homogeneity and based on small stochasticity (i.e. Wiener process with typical variance 0.01) is questionable. We anticipate similar realistic models to be used for real world applications and aggregation methods based on them, especially for cold loads and similar TCLs, where external factors and heterogeneity in time are significant. DR control frameworks for TCLs should also be designed with that behaviour in mind and the developed bottom up model can be used to evaluate their accuracy. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Financial development is measured by six individual indicators and by a comprehensive indicator obtained through the PCA method. We also account for regional heterogeneity by dividing our sample into three regions: eastern region, central region, and western region. We underline our findings in three aspects. First, financial development measured by most individual indicators (m2, credit, revenue of the insurance industry, and stock market value) and the comprehensive one has a significantly negative impact on economic growth. Second, energy consumption can significantly contribute to economic growth in all regions, while no feedback effect is found except in the western region. This result is further supported by the Granger causality tests. Last, financial development in the sense of m2, credit, stock turnover, and the comprehensive indicator can significantly lessen energy consumption in all regions.

However, due to the limited form factor required, there remains a challenging issue that limits even more the success of wearable devices: the limited lifetime due to the small energy storages that supply the devices. This limitation affects usability and forces the data processing to keep low-complexity to match the power constraints. As wireless communication is typically the most power hungry activity in wearable sensors devices, many techniques focus on reducing the communication power consumption. For this reason, advanced power management can be exploited to increase the lifetime of the devices. In this work, we present a wireless body area network with an adaptive power management strategy combining an ultra-low power wake up radio with context awareness. The context aware power manager is based on activity recognition, which is evaluated to decide which other nodes must be activated. The nano-power wake up receiver is used to reduce the idle listening power of the main radio and enable an asynchronous ultra-low power protocol. In order to evaluate the benefit, we present a real world application to assist elderly people in gait rehabilitation through a closed loop feedback.

Its physical origin lies in the kiloparsec-scale interaction of AGN jets with the intracluster medium. Large-scale jet simulations often initiate light internally supersonic jets with density contrast 0.01 < eta < 1. Here we argue for the first time for the importance of very light (eta < 0.01) internally subsonic jets. We investigated the shapes of young X-ray cavities produced in a suite of hydrodynamic simulations, and found that bottom-wide cavities are always produced by internally subsonic jets, while internally supersonic jets inflate cylindrical, center-wide, or top-wide cavities. We found examples of real cavities with shapes analogous to those inflated in our simulations by internally subsonic and internally supersonic jets, suggesting a dichotomy of AGN jets according to their internal Mach numbers. We further studied the long-term cavity evolution, and found that old cavities resulted from light jets spread along the jet direction, while those produced by very light jets are significantly elongated along the perpendicular direction. The northwestern ghost cavity in Perseus is pancake shaped, providing tentative evidence for the existence of very light jets. Our simulations show that very light internally subsonic jets decelerate faster and rise much slower in the intracluster medium than light internally supersonic jets, possibly depositing a larger fraction of jet energy to cluster cores and alleviating the problem of low coupling efficiencies found previously. The internal Mach number points to the jet's energy content, and internally subsonic jets are energetically dominated by non-kinetic energy, such as thermal energy, cosmic rays, or magnetic fields.",,,False,,,810692,,2018-06-29 06:19:34.715106+00:00,0,False,,,ON THE IMPORTANCE OF VERY LIGHT INTERNALLY SUBSONIC AGN JETS IN RADIO-MODE AGN FEEDBACK,False,,,True,

State-of-the-art Smart Grid design needs innovation in a number of dimensions: distributed and dynamic network with two-way information and energy transmission, seamless integration of renewable energy sources, management of intermittent power supplies, real time demand response, and energy pricing strategy. One of the important aspects for the power system to operate in such a manner is accurate and consistent short term load forecasting (STLF). This paper presents a methodology for the STLF using the similar day concept combined with fuzzy logic approach and swarm intelligence technique. A Euclidean distance norm with weight factors considering the weather variables and day type is used for finding the similar days. Fuzzy logic is used to modify the load curves of the selected similar days of the forecast by generating the correction factors for them. The input parameters for the fuzzy system are the average load, average temperature and average humidity differences of the forecasted previous day and its similar days. These correction factors are applied to the similar days of the forecast day.

Smart appliances and Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEV) at the residential end-user premises constitute a typical example. Nevertheless, a distribution system (DS) that has been designed and operated by a distribution system operator (DSO) for decades considering only inflexible consumers has to be equipped with appropriate operating strategies and technological upgrades in order to adapt to the new conditions. This study examines the case in which PEV have penetrated in the DS without any supportive operational strategy. Next, a coordination strategy employed from the DSO for EV charging together with the scheduling of smart-appliances is proposed. In both cases, the selection of the daily optimal radial configuration of the DS is considered in order to facilitate the operational goals of the DSO. The optimality criterion is the minimization of the active power losses and both cases are compared by means of operational performance. © 2014 IEEE.",,,False,,,810744,,2018-07-09 09:28:12.930751+00:00,0,False,,,Coordination of smart-household activities for the efficient operation of intelligent distribution systems,False,,,False,

The average load during the peak period of noon to 7pm was examined and found to be constant versus the dropped packet rate, though thermostate controllers, in response to higher prices, were able to reduce the energy bill by shifting air conditioning usage out of high price periods.

To realize such a smart grid, large scale pilot projects are currently implemented and evaluated. Such pilot projects generate an excessive amount of data that needs to be processed: energy measurements, information on available flexibility from smart devices that can be shifted in time, control signals, dynamic prices, environmental data, etc. To validate and analyze the gathered data and adjust the running experiments in real-time, an optimized data management infrastructure is needed as well as comprehensive visualization tools.

Benefited from the random nature of the chaos, conventional CW chaos lidars already possess excellent anti-jamming and anti-interference capabilities and have no range ambiguity. In our system, we further employ self-homodyning and time gating to generate a pulsed homodyned chaos to boost the energy-utilization efficiency. Compared to the original chaos, we show that the pulsed homodyned chaos improves the detection SNR by more than 20 dB. With a sampling rate of just 1.25 GS/s that has a native sampling spacing of 12 cm, we successfully achieve millimeter-level accuracy and precision in ranging. Compared with two commercial lidars tested side-by-side, namely the pulsed Spectroscan and the random-modulation continuous-wave Lidar-lite, the pulsed chaos lidar that is in compliance with the class-1 eye-safe regulation shows significantly better precision and a much longer detection range up to 100 m.

1100,1334,2018,WOS:000431162100044,,False,"This paper proposes an agent-based model that combines both spot and balancing electricity markets. From this model, we develop a multi-agent simulation to study the integration of the consumers' flexibility into the system. Our study identifies the conditions that real-time prices may lead to higher electricity costs, which in turn contradicts the usual claim that such a pricing scheme reduces cost. We show that such undesirable behavior is in fact systemic. Due to the existing structure of the wholesale market, the predicted demand that is used in the formation of the price is never realized since the flexible users will change their demand according to such established price. As the demand is never correctly predicted, the volume traded through the balancing markets increases, leading to higher overall costs. In this case, the system can sustain, and even benefit from, a small number of flexible users, but this solution can never upscale without increasing the total costs. To avoid this problem, we implement the so-called ""exclusive groups"". Our results illustrate the importance of rethinking the current practices so that flexibility can be successfully integrated considering scenarios with and without intermittent renewable sources.

Quality of experience has become the most important parameter to lead the service providers to know about the end-user feedback. Implementing Hypertext Transfer Protocol adaptive streaming applications to find out QoE in real-life scenarios of vast networks becomes more challenging and complex task regarding to cost, agile, time, and decisions. In this paper, a virtualized network testbed to virtualize various machines to support implementing experiments of adaptive video streaming has been developed. Within the test study, the metrics which demonstrate performance of QoE are investigated, respectively, including initial delay (ie, startup delay at the beginning of playback a video), frequency switches (ie, number of times the quality is changed), accumulative video time (ie, number and length of stalls), CPU usage, and battery energy consumption. Furthermore, the relation between effective parameters of QoS on the aforementioned metrics for different segment length is investigated. Experimental results show that the proposed virtualized system is agile, easy to install and use, and costs less than real testbeds. Moreover, the subjective and objective performance studies of QoE evaluation in the system have proven that the segment lengths of 6 to 8seconds were faired and more efficient than others according to the investigated parameters.",,,False,,,813710,,2018-07-09 09:34:21.786195+00:00,0,False,,,Adaptive video streaming testbed design for performance study and assessment of QoE,False,,,True,

Cloud computing is a competitive choice for this, with powerful computational capabilities. However, it sacrifices real-time feature and energy efficiency. Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is with high performance and efficiency, which is not cost-effective for diverse applications. The general-purpose microcontroller is of low performance. Therefore, it is a challenge to do stream mining on these low-cost devices with scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce an FPGA-based scalable and parameterized architecture for stream mining. Particularly, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) based k-Nearest Neighbor (k NN) is adopted in the architecture. Two processing element (PE) rings for DTWand k NN are designed to achieve parameterization and scalability with high performance.

1103,1337,2018,WOS:000432477400045,,False,"In the domain of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) applications, organic electroactive materials play a crucial role. In order to allow for more flexibility in their properties, methoxy or other substituents are frequently used. However, undesirable modifications in their polarity may be additionally obtained, which is particularly important in the case of TADF-based OLEDs. In order to dissociate as much as possible intramolecular and bulk effects, we synthesized two series of methoxy-substituted carbazole-bridge-carbazole (bridge = carbazolyl, phenyl) compounds and characterized them by means of experimental and theoretical methods. V-shape (3,6) substitutions on the carbazole bridge and linear (para-phenyl) bisubstitutions were used in the new compounds. By varying the number of methoxy groups from 0 to 4 per carbazole unit, we analyze the effect of the number and the linking topology of the methoxy substitutions on the thermal, electronic, and optical properties of the molecules. The results indicate that the variations of the redox and fluorescence properties upon methoxy substitutions depend importantly on the linear- versus V-shape D-A-D molecular architecture, due to the absence and presence, respectively, of the dipolar moments and of the bulk polarity. The choice of the molecular architecture and methoxy substitutions can be used consequently to switch on/off the molecular polarity and to tune the sensitivity of redox and optical properties of electroactive materials with respect to medium electrostatic effects. These compounds were additionally utilized in blue phosphorescence organic light-emitting devices and showed good hole-transporting, exciton-blocking, and electron-blocking properties.",,,False,,,813712,,2018-07-09 09:34:47.860773+00:00,0,False,,,Sensitivity of Redox and Optical Properties of Electroactive Carbazole Derivatives to the Molecular Architecture and Methoxy Substitutions,False,,,True,

This paper aims to report on a pilot programme aimed at reducing energy consumption via behaviour change interventions, variably applied in residences at Rhodes University, South Africa. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected via structured questionnaires, energy consumption records and post-intervention programme focus group discussions. Findings - Participant residences that received a mix of different interventions in the forms of pamphlets, face-to-face discussions, incentives and feedback recorded more energy reductions of up to 9 per cent than residences that received a single or no intervention. In post-experiment discussions, students cited personal, institutional and structural barriers to pro-environmental energy-use behaviour. Practical implications - Overall, the results of this study suggest that information provision of energy-saving tips combined with regular feedback and incentives can result in energy-use reductions in university residences, which may yield environmental and economic benefits for universities, but addressing barriers to pro-environmental behaviour might maximise the results.

Various pricing structures incentivizing consumers to shift energy consumption from on-peak to off-peak periods are evident in this field. Most DR methods currently used in practice belong to static variable pricing (e.g., Time of Use, Critical Peak Pricing) and the impact of such tariffs has been well established. However, dynamic variable pricing in general is less studied and much less practiced in the field, due to the lack of understanding of consumer behavior in response to price uncertainty. In this article, we study a novel dynamic variable pricing scheme that uses the coincident demand charge to reduce load consumption during peak events. We employ a multi-attribute utility function and model predictive control to simulate consumer behavior of utility maximization in home energy consumption. We use a conditional Markov chain to model and predict the system peak. Effects of the proposed residential electricity rate based on coincident demand charge are compared with other pricing schemes through simulation validated with real-world residential load profiles. Finally, we extend the simulations to study the impact of integrating renewable solar production in a DR program.

With the incorporation of the information and communication technology (ICT) into the electricity grids, they are becoming more and more intelligent and efficient. Recently, much attention has been drawn toward managing the loads in response to varying electricity price and availability while also considering user preferences. Such management systems are usually referred to as Demand Side Management (DSM) systems. DSM systems are capable of considering both the satisfaction of consumers and the cost of electricity provision, and make a balance between these typically conflicting objectives. In this paper, we analyse and compare two market based decentralized approaches proposed for such DSM systems based on dynamic pricing. We study these approaches to examine the role of consumer satisfaction on the consumption schedules of residential consumers. We also investigate the interaction between consumers and mutual influences they have on each others when consumers' satisfaction are taken into account. Through the comparative experimentation we show how the satisfaction, costs, payment and social benefits of consumers are affected when they indirectly cooperate with each other to optimize the aggregated consumption in the microgrid. © 2016 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

The customers can maximize their utility by making strategic purchase decisions while suppliers can leverage on the early purchase decisions to develop a better cost-effective plan to serve the demands. A crucial observation is that the flexibility of storing energy in a battery separates the time of purchase and time of use for the stored energy. This can be exploited to address a rising privacy concern amongst the smart grid users which is maintaining the confidentiality of the consumption profile of the customers. In this paper, we propose an embedded unit that implements an energy purchase strategy which integrates ahead of time purchases with the privacy concern of the customers in a cost effective fashion.
